This page is oriented primarily to students registered in the course at the University of Austin, but visitors are welcome. General information for visitors is available *via* the [About page](about.qmd).

A typical class week consists of one or two of the topics listed sequentially below and includes textbook readings, homework exercises, self-study drill questions, and a short weekly quiz.

Topics: 

i. Modeling, the broad framework for quantitative reasoning
i. Quantities and dimensions
i. Rates and their uses
i. Magnitudes for representing the very big along side the very small
i. Function building blocks. Functions are the links between quantities in our models.
i. Uncertain quantities. Functions also provide a way to represent uncertainty.
i. Custom design of functions, to power the models we build
i. Hypothesis and likelihood, to connect data to models and conclusion
i. Bayesian reasoning, updating our beliefs based on evidence
i. Dynamics, the study of systems that change in time
i. Rates of change, a revolution in quantitative thinking
i. Accumulation, the flip side of rates of change
