    "text": "At the University of Austin, our students pursue a Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Studies. As part of their required course of study, students must complete a core curriculum called the Intellectual Foundations, which consists of 15 intensive courses that introduce students to the various languages of understanding and teach them to see things whole. As part of this sequence, students are challenged to confront timeless questions beginning in antiquity and culminating in the present day.\nThere are two quantitative reasoning courses in the Intellectual Foundation curriculum. These are:\n\nQuantitative Reasoning I (“QR — Analysis”), which teaches students the mathematical modeling tools useful for modelling real-world phenomena.\nQuantitative Reasoning II (“QR — Data”), which teaches students to extract useful information from data using modern data science techniques.\n\nBoth QR — Analysis and QR — Data are unlike the introductory courses found at almost all other colleges and universities. We have selected topics based on their utility in modern professional work. In contrast, basic topics in the traditional curriculum reflect the historical development of mathematics rather than the needs of modern work. Modern topics widely used in the economy and scientific/technical worlds are relegated to so-called “advanced” courses far downstream where they are inaccessible to almost all students.\nOur two QR courses dramatically streamline the pre-requisites for successful work with modern quantitative topics. Surprisingly often the “advanced” topics are readily accessible to students, so long as one is willing to move beyond traditional pedagogy and avoid unwarranted devotion to topics that were important historically but are no longer necessarily for understanding.",

Remember that “power” has a different dimension than energy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5 Light bulbs generally have a quantity printed on them: the wattage. Similarly, light-bulb sockets often have a “max watts” label advising the user of the largest wattage bulb that can work safely in the socket.\n\nPart a\n\nWhat is the dimension of a watt?\n\n\n\n bulb-wattage\n\n   Energy        Power        Electrical voltage        Electrical current         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nSince people don’t directly perceive electrical current or voltage, it is hard to form an intuition about them. Instead, training is required to interpret properly the meanings of electrical dimensions.\nAn exact mathematical analogy to electrical dimensions can be made to water and flow. You turn on the shower and step in for four minutes. As you shower, at each instant you can feel the “intensity” (flow) of the spray from the shower-head. You even have a faucet to set the flow. This flow is analogous to the power used by a light bulb.\nOver the full course of your 4-minute shower, six gallons of water goes down the train. Gallons, of course, have the dimension of volume. You used those six gallons over four minutes. Consequently, the flow of water is \\(\\frac{6\\, \\text{gallons}}{4\\, \\text{minutes}} = 1.5\\, \\text{gallons per minute}\\). The volume of water used in your shower session is analogous to the energy used by a light bulb: it is power multiplied by duration. ..id..\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\n\nThe brightness of the light emitted by a light bulb is proportional to power. Suppose you turn on a 20-watt light when you walk into a room. This consumes energy. The energy used by the bulb is the power multiplied by the duration that the light was on.\n\n\n\nIf you stay in the room for 1 hour, turning off the light when you leave, how much energy has the light consumed?\n\n\n light-bulb-b1\n\n   20 watts        20 watt-hours        Not enough information is given        1 hour         \n\n\n\n\n\nIn terms of the fundamental dimensions—L, M, T—energy has dimension L2 M T-2. What is the dimension of power?\n\n\n light-bulb-b2\n\n   L2 M T-1        L2 M T-2        L2 M T-3         \n\n\n\n\n\nYou might reasonably ask, “What does mass have to do with energy?” Perhaps you remember Einstein’s famous equation for energy: \\[E = m\\, c^2\\] where \\(m\\) is mass and \\(c\\) is the speed of light. What is the dimension of \\(c^2\\)?\n\n\n light-bulb-b3\n\n   L T        L        L T-1        L T-2        L2 T-2         \n\n\n\n\nConsequently, \\(m\\, c^2\\) has the dimension of energy.\n\nPart c\n\nConsider this statement:\n\n\n\nPower consumption is a property of the light bulb, but energy consumption involves both the light bulb itself and the pattern of usage.\n\n    light-bulb-c1\n\n   True     or        False         \n\n\n\n\nPart d\n\nA typical household uses about 10 kilowatt-hours of energy per day. “10 kilowatt-hours” is an amount of energy, but “energy per day” is a flow of energy, that is, a power.\n\n\n\nTranslate “10 kilowatt-hours of energy per day” into the equivalent watts. For simplicity in the calculation, assume that the energy is used evenly over the 24-hour day.\n\n\n light-bulb-d1\n\n   417 watts        10,000 watts        240,000 watts        Not enough information         \n\n\n\n\n\nLook up the power consumption of a hand-held blow-dryer. When the blow-dryer is in use, energy consumption of the household increases. Which of these is a plausible fraction of average household power consumed by the hair-dryer?\n\n\n light-bulb-d2\n\n   10% of average power        50% of average power        100% of average power        200% of average power         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 6 Perhaps unsurprisingly, the power of an automobile engine has the dimension of power.\nImagine a car with a 100 horsepower engine. What is the equivalent value in units of watts.\n\n light-bulb-e3\n\n\n 735.5 watts\n\n\n 7355 watts\n\n\n 73,550 watts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 7 Chapter 2 quoted a list from Arithmetic for the practical man by J.E. Thompson (1931). He wrote:\n\nCommon measurements are of several kinds ….

Here is part of an article entitled “Fear the deficit-populism doom loop” from Aug 24, 2025.\n\nYou are a finance minister after a decade of meagre economic growth, shocks from a financial crisis, a pandemic and sky-high energy prices. Public debt is worth more than your country’s gross domestic product, interest rates are at their highest in years and merely servicing outstanding debt is taking up an ever-greater share of tax revenue. Inflation is stubborn. America’s profligacy is satisfying much of the world’s appetite for government bonds, meaning your debt must pay more to attract investors. You lie awake worrying about how to make the numbers add up.\n\n\nWhat are the dimensions of public debt? S in units of whatever is the relevant currency.\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the dimensions of gross domestic product? S T-1\n\n\n\n\nIt’s quantitatively incorrect to compare public debt with gross domestic product.\n\nWhat dimension must the quantity be that multiplies gross domestic product in order to convert it to a quantity that is directly comparable with public debt?\nLet’s give the name B to the quantity in (i). You know the dimension of B, but to perform the multiplication you need to choose a value for B. Is there a value for B that is obviously correct? If you say “no,” explain why not. If you say “yes,” explain the reasoning behind its being obvious.\n\n\n\n\nThe Economist article continues:\n\nThis is the bind facing governments in much of the rich world. The average fiscal deficit in the OECD, a club of mostly rich countries, hit 4.6% of GDP last year, up from an average of 2.9% in the four years before the covid-19 pandemic; interest payments on outstanding debt came to 3.3% of GDP, only just below the amount Nato members hope to spend on defence by 2035. The political-science literature offers some comfort—austerity is not usually a barrier to re-election—but also a warning. Research shows a link between spending cuts and populist success. Indeed, in Britain, France and Germany such parties are already ascendant. Call it the deficit-populism doom loop: ministers face both big deficits and voter revolts, and there is little way of satisfying both the bond markets and the barbarians at the gate.\n\n\nIf fiscal deficit can be stated as a percentage of GDP, what does that say about the dimension of fiscal deficit?\n\n\n\n\nExplain what’s different between fiscal deficit and debt.\n\n\n\n\nFiscal deficit can be reckoned as the sum of 1) interest payments on the debt (3.3%) and 2) the amount of other spending (on education, pensions, military, etc.) in excess of government income (taxes, etc.) By what percentage would spending need to decrease or taxes need to increase in order to eliminate the fiscal deficit?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 9 There are several ways to measure transportation services. Let’s focus here on the transportation of people. The distance of transport is, obviously, an important aspect of transportation services. So it the number of people transported.\nIn a proper measure of transportation services, it seems reasonable that the longer the distance, the more transportation being provided, so long as the number of passengers is the same. Similarly, the more passengers carried, so long as the distance is the same, the more transportation is provided.\n\nWhich of the following is a sensible way to measure the amount of transportation?\n\n\n prw-base-wlci\n\n\n People plus miles\n\n\n People per mile\n\n\n Miles per person\n\n\n Miles \\(\\times \\sqrt{\\strut\\text{person}}\\)\n\n\n Persons \\(\\times\\) miles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n100 passengers are on a flight covering 500 miles. How much transportation service is provided to the group of passengers?\n\n\n prw-2-cksd\n\n\n 500 passenger miles\n\n\n 5000 passenger miles\n\n\n 50,000 passenger miles\n\n\n 500,000 passenger miles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany people are concerned with the amount of fuel used in air travel. For modern jets (with a full load of passengers), the amount of fuel used is approximately 0.02 to 0.03 gallons per passenger mile.\n\nWhat is the dimension of “gallons per passenger mile?”\n\n\n prw-3-kdlw\n\n\n L^4 C-1\n\n\n L^3 C-1\n\n\n L^2 C-1\n\n\n L C-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople in the US are used to measuring fuel economy in “miles per gallon.” This contrasts with the style in much of the rest of the world the unit is “liters per 100 km.” Assume that a group of friends is travelling 600 miles to a concert. They could fly or drive. If there are three friends, how many gallons of fuel will the one-way air travel consume (for these three passengers)? (Pick the closest answer.)\n\n\n prw-4-cksd\n\n\n 15 gallons\n\n\n 30 gallons\n\n\n 150 gallons\n\n\n 300 gallons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow imagine the three friends are carpooling to the concert in a car that gets 30 miles per gallon. How many gallons of fuel will the one-way drive consume for all three passengers. (Pick the closest answer.)\n\n\n prw-5-wels\n\n\n 20 gallons\n\n\n 60 gallons\n\n\n 200 gallons\n\n\n 300 gallons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome people reason that it does not consume any fuel for the three friends to fly, since even if they didn’t fly the plane would consume the same amount of fuel. Are you sympathetic to this argument? Explain why or why not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 10 NOT FOUND: Exercise 2.18\n\n\n\n\nExercise 11 Figure 2.1 displays child mortality versus gross domestic product (GDP) on a country-by-country basis. Child mortality is operationalized as the number of children who die between birth and their fifth birthday. It is a “rate” because the number given is a ratio of the number of deaths in this group to the total number of children in this group, but is given in units of “deaths per 1000 children.” That is, the ratio is dimensionless with dimension C C-1 = [1], (Strictly speaking, the rate should be called “Under-five mortality.”)\nGDP is often presented as the value of goods and services produced by a country in one year. The quantity shown here is also a rate, described in the label of the graph as “GDP per capita.” The dimension of the GDP is W T-1 C-1. The operationalization of GDP is defined in a way that makes it relatively easy to measure from government and commercial records. All goods and services for which money is exchanged are included. No goods and services for which money is not exchanged are included. Thus, GDP ignores the value provided by, for instance, home child care and home meal preparation. A country which switched from home-cooked meals to fast food would see a sharp increase in GDP but, perhaps, a decrease in nutrition. Paid work need not be productive to be included in GDP. No adjustment is made for losses due to accidents, disasters, or depreciation of buildings and other capital.\nAnother factor not included in GDP is the price level in each country. Price levels vary from country to country and also from year to year. In Figure 2.1, not only is a comparison made between countries, but also between years. GDP numbers used for international or inter-year comparison are often, as here, adjusted for the “price level” in each country in each year. The price level is determined by what it costs to buy a “market basket” of goods. And that price level varies over the years, a process we call “inflation.”\nThe GDP per capita presented in Figure 2.1 is adjusted for price level. The adjustment is often referred to as PPP, short for purchasing power parity. The units are 2011 “International Dollars,” a hypothetical currency for comparison between countries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Child mortality (deaths per 1000) versus GDP for 1960 and 2020.
