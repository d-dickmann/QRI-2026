They use a linear combination of two storybook functions: one term captures a base level of sales, and another captures sales that grow with how long the café is open.\nSuppose the model is\n\\(R(t) = 50\\cdot\\) flat\\(() + 120\\cdot\\) steady\\((t)\\).\nSo revenue equals 50 (dollars base) plus 120 times the number of hours open: flat() is the constant function (value 1) and steady(\\(t\\)) = \\(t\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

(Pipelining is also known as piping or composing functions.)\n\nIn display form:\n\nMultiplication: \\(h(x) = f(x)\\cdot g(x)\\)\n\nPipelining: \\(h(x) = f(g(x))\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Consider the function \\(h(x) =\\) steady\\((x)\\cdot\\) steady\\((x)\\).

In the expression (j(x, z) = f(x),g(z)), how many inputs does (j) have, and is this multiplication or pipelining?\n\n obd-jxz\n\n\n One input; pipelining\n\n\n One input; multiplication\n\n\n Two inputs; pipelining\n\n\n Two inputs; multiplication\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Give a one-sentence reason why (f(x)g(x)) and (f(g(x))) are different in general.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3 Two-input functions and interaction\nIn an epidemic model, new cases per day may depend on both the number of susceptible people (S) and the number of infective people (I). So we want a function of two inputs: new_cases(\\(S\\), \\(I\\)). A simple choice is to use a linear combination where each ingredient is a function of one input: e.g. \\(a\\,f(S) + b\\,g(I)\\). Another option is to use function multiplication with two inputs: \\(f(S)\\,g(I)\\).\n1. If we want new cases to be large when both (S) and (I) are large, and small when either (S) or (I) is small, which of these forms is more appropriate?\n\n msf-form\n\n\n A linear combination \\(a\\cdot\\)steady(\\(S\\)) \\(+ b\\cdot\\)steady(\\(I\\)) (effect of S and I just add)\n\n\n A product like steady(\\(S\\))·steady(\\(I\\))\n\n\n A pipeline steady(\\(S\\))(steady(\\(I\\)))\n\n\n flat() only\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. The form steady(\\(S\\))·steady(\\(I\\)) is often called an interaction term. In words, when is this term large?\n\n msf-interaction\n\n\n When S is large or I is large\n\n\n When S and I are both large\n\n\n When S equals I\n\n\n When either S or I is zero\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. A model of student performance might use perf(income, ed, skill) \\(= a\\cdot\\)steady(income) \\(+ b\\cdot\\)steady(skill) \\(+ c\\cdot\\)steady(ed) \\(+ d\\cdot\\)flat(). Here the modeler implicitly used which storybook functions for each input?\n\n msf-perf\n\n\n hill(\\(x\\)) for each\n\n\n steady(\\(x\\)) for income, skill, and ed; flat() for the constant\n\n\n flat() for all\n\n\n hillside(\\(x\\)) for all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. If we suspect that the effect of income on performance diminishes at high income (diminishing returns), we might replace the term that depends on income with a different storybook function. Which would be a reasonable replacement for steady(income)?\n\n msf-replace\n\n\n flat()\n\n\n magnitude(\\(x\\)) or hillside(\\(x\\))\n\n\n osc(\\(x\\))\n\n\n recip(\\(x\\))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. The algebraic form of steady(\\(S\\))·steady(\\(I\\)) is usually written as:\n msf-algebraic\n\n   S + I        S * I        S / I        S - I         \n\n\n\n6. In one sentence, why might an interaction term be useful when “the effect of x depends on the size of z”?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4 Polynomials and monomials\nA polynomial is a linear combination of simpler functions called monomials. Using storybook names: flat(), steady(\\(x\\)), steady(\\(x\\))·steady(\\(x\\)), steady(\\(x\\))·steady(\\(x\\))·steady(\\(x\\)), and so on. In algebra we write these as 1, \\(x\\), \\(x^2\\), \\(x^3\\), etc. So the quadratic polynomial \\(a x^2 + b x + c\\) is a linear combination of three ingredient functions.\n1. In the quadratic \\(a x^2 + b x + c\\), which storybook function corresponds to the term \\(x^2\\)?\n\n cow-x2\n\n\n flat()\n\n\n steady(\\(x\\))\n\n\n steady(\\(x\\))·steady(\\(x\\)) (i.e. \\(x^2\\))\n\n\n hillside(\\(x\\))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. The “poly” in polynomial means “many.” Many of what?\n\n cow-poly\n\n\n Many coefficients\n\n\n Many inputs\n\n\n Many terms (monomials) in the linear combination\n\n\n Many outputs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. What are the three monomials (ingredient functions) in the quadratic (5x^2 - 3x + 10)?\n\n cow-monomials\n\n\n 5, -3, 10\n\n\n (5x^2), (-3x), 10\n\n\n \\(x^2\\), \\(x\\), and the constant 1 (i.e. flat())\n\n\n steady(\\(x\\))·steady(\\(x\\)), steady(\\(x\\)), flat()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. The quadratic formula (x_0 = ) is used for what purpose?\n\n cow-formula\n\n\n To evaluate a polynomial at a point\n\n\n To find zeros of a quadratic polynomial\n\n\n To multiply two polynomials\n\n\n To differentiate a polynomial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. In modeling, polynomials are sometimes used as “modeling clay” because they are flexible. What is a limitation of interpreting a polynomial model in terms of mechanism?\n\n cow-mechanism\n\n\n They cannot have zeros.\n\n\n The polynomial itself does not tell you the underlying mechanism.\n\n\n They only work for one input.\n\n\n They are never used in practice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Write the quadratic \\(2x^2 + 7x - 1\\) in the form “coefficient × storybook form” for each term (e.g. \\(a\\cdot\\)flat\\(() + b\\cdot\\)steady\\((x) + \\cdots\\)). Use the function names flat(), steady(\\(x\\)), and steady(\\(x\\))·steady(\\(x\\)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5 Input transformation (pipelining)\nAn input transformation is a way to scale or shift the input to a function. We use pipelining: the interior function is (g(x) = a x + b) (a linear combination of steady and flat), and the exterior function is any storybook function. So we get (f(g(x)) = f(a x + b)). This lets us change the horizontal scale and position of a shape like hill() or osc().\nSuppose we want a hill that peaks at \\(x = 3\\) instead of at \\(x = 0\\). We use hill(steady(\\(x\\)) − 3) = hill(\\(x - 3\\)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. In hill(\\(x - 3\\)), which function is in the interior position?\n\n ncl-interior\n\n\n hill(\\(x\\))\n\n\n The linear function that sends \\(x\\) to \\(x - 3\\) (i.e. steady(\\(x\\)) − 3)\n\n\n steady(\\(x\\))\n\n\n flat()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. To make osc(\\(x\\)) have a period of 24 (e.g. for hours in a day), we need the argument of osc to go from 0 to 1 as the input goes from 0 to 24. What should go inside osc(···)?\n\n ncl-period\n\n\n osc(\\(24x\\))\n\n\n osc(\\(x/24\\))\n\n\n osc(\\(x - 24\\))\n\n\n osc(24)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. The basic osc(\\(t\\)) peaks when \\(t = 0.25\\). If we use osc(hour/24) for “hour of day” (0–24), at what hour does the oscillation first peak?\n ncl-peak-hour\n\n   0        6        12        24         \n\n\n\n4. To shift the peak to 4 PM (hour 16), we could use osc((hour − 16)/24). What is the role of the −16?\n\n ncl-shift\n\n\n It changes the period.\n\n\n It shifts the horizontal position so the peak occurs at hour 16.\n\n\n It changes the amplitude.\n\n\n It makes the function run backwards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. True or false: The output transformation (scaling and shifting the vertical axis) is also a linear combination.\n\n ncl-output\n\n\n True\n\n\n False\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. In one or two sentences, explain the difference between an input transformation and an output transformation when composing a function."

City and local governments keep detailed information about the housing stock, largely for tax purposes. Services like &lt;zillow.com&gt; have data readily available to the public.\nQuestion: What about the houses listed on Zillow might presented a view biased to houses in better condition?\n\n\nA life-cycle assessment of a sample of US houses and apartments by Aktas and Bilic (2012) produced the following graphic about how long houses and apartments remain habitable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: “Lifetime distribution of residential buildings calculated from multiple American Housing Survey microdata,” from Aktas and Bilic 2012.\n\n\n\nQuestion: Is the graph consistent with the claim that 7% of US housing stock was built before 1920?\n\n\nQuestion: Speculate on what might account for the rightward shift of the curve over the ten year period considered. Consider these two hypotheses:\n\nhouse building techniques have been improving. (When would they have had to improve to produce the curve shift?)\nthe current housing shortage has resulted in buildings being used after the time that they would have been replaced were there no housing shortage?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2 Consider this simple, made-up mortality table that might be representative of a bird species, e.g. robins.\n\n\n\nAge\nMortality\nStarting Population\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n1000\n\n\n1\n0.50\n500\n\n\n2\n0.50\n250\n\n\n3\n1.00\n125\n\n\n4\n\n0\n\n\n\nCalculate the life expectancy for these birds. Give a number, but also explain you reasoning in words. (Hint: It’s not a long calculation.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: The version of the SIR model built-in to Chapter 1 of the textbook does not work reliably. Use this link to access the model via a different web service. Follow the Models/SIR menu at the top of the new page.\n\nExercise 3 Using the SIR model in the text: (NOTE: Some students have experienced problems getting the SIR model to load. If you are among these, work with a colleague whose SIR model is functional. Sorry for the inconvenience.)\n\nDescribe the behavior of the number of infected persons with time in cases of the following policy options:\n\nSocial Distancing = 9’; Isolation = 10%\nSocial Distancing = 3’; Isolation = 40%\n\n\n\n\n\nHow many people ultimately are infected under each of these policies?\n\n\n\n\nWhich of these is preferable to the other, and why?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteDrill for chapter two\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen drill questions in this document\nRemember to submit your drill answers through that document. But for the exercises in the present document, use the “collect answers” at the top of this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteChapter Two\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.5.6.7.8.9.10.\n\n\n\nExercise 4 Name five units for energy. Remember that “power” has a different dimension than energy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5 Light bulbs generally have a quantity printed on them: the wattage. Similarly, light-bulb sockets often have a “max watts” label advising the user of the largest wattage bulb that can work safely in the socket.\n\nPart a\n\nWhat is the dimension of a watt?\n\n\n\n bulb-wattage\n\n   Energy        Power        Electrical voltage        Electrical current         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nSince people don’t directly perceive electrical current or voltage, it is hard to form an intuition about them. Instead, training is required to interpret properly the meanings of electrical dimensions.\nAn exact mathematical analogy to electrical dimensions can be made to water and flow. You turn on the shower and step in for four minutes. As you shower, at each instant you can feel the “intensity” (flow) of the spray from the shower-head. You even have a faucet to set the flow. This flow is analogous to the power used by a light bulb.\nOver the full course of your 4-minute shower, six gallons of water goes down the train. Gallons, of course, have the dimension of volume. You used those six gallons over four minutes. Consequently, the flow of water is \\(\\frac{6\\, \\text{gallons}}{4\\, \\text{minutes}} = 1.5\\, \\text{gallons per minute}\\). The volume of water used in your shower session is analogous to the energy used by a light bulb: it is power multiplied by duration. ..id..\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\n\nThe brightness of the light emitted by a light bulb is proportional to power. Suppose you turn on a 20-watt light when you walk into a room. This consumes energy. The energy used by the bulb is the power multiplied by the duration that the light was on.\n\n\n\nIf you stay in the room for 1 hour, turning off the light when you leave, how much energy has the light consumed?\n\n\n light-bulb-b1\n\n   20 watts        20 watt-hours        Not enough information is given        1 hour         \n\n\n\n\n\nIn terms of the fundamental dimensions—L, M, T—energy has dimension L2 M T-2. What is the dimension of power?\n\n\n light-bulb-b2\n\n   L2 M T-1        L2 M T-2        L2 M T-3         \n\n\n\n\n\nYou might reasonably ask, “What does mass have to do with energy?” Perhaps you remember Einstein’s famous equation for energy: \\[E = m\\, c^2\\] where \\(m\\) is mass and \\(c\\) is the speed of light. What is the dimension of \\(c^2\\)?\n\n\n light-bulb-b3\n\n   L T        L        L T-1        L T-2        L2 T-2         \n\n\n\n\nConsequently, \\(m\\, c^2\\) has the dimension of energy.\n\nPart c\n\nConsider this statement:\n\n\n\nPower consumption is a property of the light bulb, but energy consumption involves both the light bulb itself and the pattern of usage.\n\n    light-bulb-c1\n\n   True     or        False         \n\n\n\n\nPart d\n\nA typical household uses about 10 kilowatt-hours of energy per day. “10 kilowatt-hours” is an amount of energy, but “energy per day” is a flow of energy, that is, a power.\n\n\n\nTranslate “10 kilowatt-hours of energy per day” into the equivalent watts. For simplicity in the calculation, assume that the energy is used evenly over the 24-hour day.\n\n\n light-bulb-d1\n\n   417 watts        10,000 watts        240,000 watts        Not enough information         \n\n\n\n\n\nLook up the power consumption of a hand-held blow-dryer. When the blow-dryer is in use, energy consumption of the household increases. Which of these is a plausible fraction of average household power consumed by the hair-dryer?\n\n\n light-bulb-d2\n\n   10% of average power        50% of average power        100% of average power        200% of average power         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 6 Perhaps unsurprisingly, the power of an automobile engine has the dimension of power.\nImagine a car with a 100 horsepower engine. What is the equivalent value in units of watts.\n\n light-bulb-e3\n\n\n 735.5 watts\n\n\n 7355 watts\n\n\n 73,550 watts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 7 Chapter 2 quoted a list from Arithmetic for the practical man by J.E. Thompson (1931). He wrote:\n\nCommon measurements are of several kinds …. The chief of the common measurements are those of\n\nLength\nSurface, or area\nVolume, or capacity\nWeight, or force of gravity\nTime\nAngles, latitude and longitude\nTemperature, or intensity of heat\nMoney, or value\n\n\nAnnotate each item of Thompson’s list with the dimension. Indicate whether it is a basic dimension or a derived dimension.\n\nPut basic dimensions here:\n\n\nPut derived dimensions here:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLength, L\nSurface, or area L \\(\\times\\) L, which we will generally write L2\nVolume, or capacity L \\(\\times\\) L \\(\\times\\) L, which we will generally write L3\nWeight, or force of gravity M \\(\\times\\) L / T2, or, written another way, M L T-2\nTime, T\nAngles, latitude and longitude [1]\nTemperature, or intensity of heat 𝛳\nMoney, or value W\n\nNote that four of them (i, v, vii, and viii) are tautologies.\n..id..\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 8 The Economist is considered one of the world’s leading news magazines. Here is part of an article entitled “Fear the deficit-populism doom loop” from Aug 24, 2025.\n\nYou are a finance minister after a decade of meagre economic growth, shocks from a financial crisis, a pandemic and sky-high energy prices. Public debt is worth more than your country’s gross domestic product, interest rates are at their highest in years and merely servicing outstanding debt is taking up an ever-greater share of tax revenue. Inflation is stubborn. America’s profligacy is satisfying much of the world’s appetite for government bonds, meaning your debt must pay more to attract investors. You lie awake worrying about how to make the numbers add up.\n\n\nWhat are the dimensions of public debt? S in units of whatever is the relevant currency.\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the dimensions of gross domestic product? S T-1\n\n\n\n\nIt’s quantitatively incorrect to compare public debt with gross domestic product.\n\nWhat dimension must the quantity be that multiplies gross domestic product in order to convert it to a quantity that is directly comparable with public debt?\nLet’s give the name B to the quantity in (i). You know the dimension of B, but to perform the multiplication you need to choose a value for B. Is there a value for B that is obviously correct? If you say “no,” explain why not. If you say “yes,” explain the reasoning behind its being obvious.\n\n\n\n\nThe Economist article continues:\n\nThis is the bind facing governments in much of the rich world. The average fiscal deficit in the OECD, a club of mostly rich countries, hit 4.6% of GDP last year, up from an average of 2.9% in the four years before the covid-19 pandemic; interest payments on outstanding debt came to 3.3% of GDP, only just below the amount Nato members hope to spend on defence by 2035. The political-science literature offers some comfort—austerity is not usually a barrier to re-election—but also a warning. Research shows a link between spending cuts and populist success. Indeed, in Britain, France and Germany such parties are already ascendant. Call it the deficit-populism doom loop: ministers face both big deficits and voter revolts, and there is little way of satisfying both the bond markets and the barbarians at the gate.\n\n\nIf fiscal deficit can be stated as a percentage of GDP, what does that say about the dimension of fiscal deficit?\n\n\n\n\nExplain what’s different between fiscal deficit and debt.\n\n\n\n\nFiscal deficit can be reckoned as the sum of 1) interest payments on the debt (3.3%) and 2) the amount of other spending (on education, pensions, military, etc.) in excess of government income (taxes, etc.) By what percentage would spending need to decrease or taxes need to increase in order to eliminate the fiscal deficit?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 9 There are several ways to measure transportation services. Let’s focus here on the transportation of people. The distance of transport is, obviously, an important aspect of transportation services. So it the number of people transported.\nIn a proper measure of transportation services, it seems reasonable that the longer the distance, the more transportation being provided, so long as the number of passengers is the same. Similarly, the more passengers carried, so long as the distance is the same, the more transportation is provided.\n\nWhich of the following is a sensible way to measure the amount of transportation?\n\n\n prw-base-wlci\n\n\n People plus miles\n\n\n People per mile\n\n\n Miles per person\n\n\n Miles \\(\\times \\sqrt{\\strut\\text{person}}\\)\n\n\n Persons \\(\\times\\) miles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n100 passengers are on a flight covering 500 miles. How much transportation service is provided to the group of passengers?\n\n\n prw-2-cksd\n\n\n 500 passenger miles\n\n\n 5000 passenger miles\n\n\n 50,000 passenger miles\n\n\n 500,000 passenger miles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany people are concerned with the amount of fuel used in air travel. For modern jets (with a full load of passengers), the amount of fuel used is approximately 0.02 to 0.03 gallons per passenger mile.\n\nWhat is the dimension of “gallons per passenger mile?”\n\n\n prw-3-kdlw\n\n\n L^4 C-1\n\n\n L^3 C-1\n\n\n L^2 C-1\n\n\n L C-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople in the US are used to measuring fuel economy in “miles per gallon.” This contrasts with the style in much of the rest of the world the unit is “liters per 100 km.” Assume that a group of friends is travelling 600 miles to a concert. They could fly or drive. If there are three friends, how many gallons of fuel will the one-way air travel consume (for these three passengers)? (Pick the closest answer.)\n\n\n prw-4-cksd\n\n\n 15 gallons\n\n\n 30 gallons\n\n\n 150 gallons\n\n\n 300 gallons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow imagine the three friends are carpooling to the concert in a car that gets 30 miles per gallon. How many gallons of fuel will the one-way drive consume for all three passengers. (Pick the closest answer.)\n\n\n prw-5-wels\n\n\n 20 gallons\n\n\n 60 gallons\n\n\n 200 gallons\n\n\n 300 gallons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome people reason that it does not consume any fuel for the three friends to fly, since even if they didn’t fly the plane would consume the same amount of fuel. Are you sympathetic to this argument? Explain why or why not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 10 Figure 2.1 displays child mortality versus gross domestic product (GDP) on a country-by-country basis. Child mortality is operationalized as the number of children who die between birth and their fifth birthday. It is a “rate” because the number given is a ratio of the number of deaths in this group to the total number of children in this group, but is given in units of “deaths per 1000 children.” That is, the ratio is dimensionless with dimension C C-1 = [1], (Strictly speaking, the rate should be called “Under-five mortality.”)\nGDP is often presented as the value of goods and services produced by a country in one year. The quantity shown here is also a rate, described in the label of the graph as “GDP per capita.” The dimension of the GDP is W T-1 C-1. The operationalization of GDP is defined in a way that makes it relatively easy to measure from government and commercial records. All goods and services for which money is exchanged are included. No goods and services for which money is not exchanged are included. Thus, GDP ignores the value provided by, for instance, home child care and home meal preparation. A country which switched from home-cooked meals to fast food would see a sharp increase in GDP but, perhaps, a decrease in nutrition. Paid work need not be productive to be included in GDP. No adjustment is made for losses due to accidents, disasters, or depreciation of buildings and other capital.\nAnother factor not included in GDP is the price level in each country. Price levels vary from country to country and also from year to year. In Figure 2.1, not only is a comparison made between countries, but also between years. GDP numbers used for international or inter-year comparison are often, as here, adjusted for the “price level” in each country in each year. The price level is determined by what it costs to buy a “market basket” of goods. And that price level varies over the years, a process we call “inflation.”\nThe GDP per capita presented in Figure 2.1 is adjusted for price level. The adjustment is often referred to as PPP, short for purchasing power parity. The units are 2011 “International Dollars,” a hypothetical currency for comparison between countries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Child mortality (deaths per 1000) versus GDP for 1960 and 2020. Source: Bolt and van Zanden – Maddison Project Database 2023 – with minor processing by [Our World in Data].\n\n\n\n\nFind two countries (in the same year) that have almost the same GDP but very different mortality rates.\n\n\n\n\nFind two countries (in the same year) that have almost the same mortality, but very different GDPs.\n\n\n\n\nDescribe the overall relationship between GDP and child mortality, as best you can discern from these data."

The data shows:\n\nAt week 0, essentially no one had seen it (views ≈ 0)\nBy week 10, about half of the eventual maximum viewers had seen it\nBy week 20, views had essentially plateaued at 2 million\n\nThe hillside() function naturally outputs ≈ 0 for large negative inputs, 0.5 when input = 0, and ≈ 1 for large positive inputs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart A: Input transformation\nThe input transformation has the form \\(a(q - q_0)\\) where \\(q\\) is the real-world input (weeks).\n\nWhat is the horizontal shift \\(q_0\\)? (At what week should hillside() output 0.5?)\n\n rpg-q0\n\n   0        0.5        5        10        20         \n\n\n\n\nWe want hillside() to output ≈ 1 around week 20 and ≈ 0 at week 0. For the output to be nearly 1, the input to hillside() should be around +5. Given \\(q_0 = 10\\), solve for \\(a\\) in: \\(a(20 - 10) = 5\\)\n\n rpg-a\n\n   0.1        0.2        0.5        1        2         \n\n\n\n\nWhat are the units of \\(a\\)?\n\n\n rpg-a-units\n\n   weeks        per week        views        dimensionless         \n\n\n\n\nPart B: Output transformation\nThe output transformation has the form \\(A \\cdot\\) hillside(···) \\(+ B\\).\n\nWhat is the vertical scaling \\(A\\)? (What value scales the output from 0–1 to 0–2,000,000?)\n\n rpg-A\n\n   1        1000        1e+06        2e+06         \n\n\n\n\nWhat are the units of \\(A\\)?\n\n\n rpg-A-units\n\n   weeks        per week        views        dimensionless         \n\n\n\n\nPart C: Build and test the model\n\nDefine your transformation parameters and plot the model. Fill in the values for a, q0, and A.\n\nIn R, you define a variable with &lt;- (the assignment arrow). For example: x &lt;- 5 stores the value 5 in a variable named x.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to your model, approximately how many views would there be at week 5?\n\n rpg-week5\n\n   about 13,000        about 150,000        about 500,000        about 1,000,000         \n\n\n\n\nModel limitations: What aspects of real viral video spread does this model fail to capture? Consider factors like the initial launch, word-of-mouth dynamics, platform algorithms, or what happens after the “plateau.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5 Time-of-Use Electricity Pricing\nYour electric utility charges different rates depending on the time of day. You want to model the price so you can decide when to charge your electric vehicle, run the dishwasher, or do laundry.\nThe utility publishes sample rates at several times of day:\n\n\n\nTime of day\nPrice ($/kWh)\n\n\n\n\n4 AM\n$0.08 (lowest)\n\n\n10 AM\n$0.20\n\n\n4 PM\n$0.32 (highest)\n\n\n10 PM\n$0.20\n\n\n\nAssume the price changes continuously and smoothly throughout the day (not in discrete steps).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour task: Build a model for electricity price (in $/kWh) as a function of hour of the day (0-24).\nOutput transformation: The output transformation scales and shifts the vertical axis.\n\nWhat is the vertical shift \\(Q_0\\) (the average price, halfway between highest and lowest)?\n\n ows-avg\n\n   0.08        0.12        0.2        0.24        0.32         \n\n\n\n\nWhat is the amplitude \\(A\\) (how far the price swings above or below the average)?\n\n ows-amp\n\n   0.08        0.12        0.2        0.24        0.32         \n\n\n\nInput transformation: The input transformation scales and shifts the horizontal axis.\n\nThe basic osc() has a period of 1. To make the model have a period of 24 hours, what goes inside osc()?\n\n ows-period\n\n   hour/24        hour*24        hour - 24        24/hour         \n\n\n\n\nThe price peaks at 4 PM (hour 16), but osc() peaks when its input equals 0.25. What horizontal shift \\(q_0\\) aligns the peak correctly?\n\n ows-shift\n\n   (hour - 10)/24        (hour + 10)/24        (hour - 4)/24        (hour + 4)/24         \n\n\n\nThe complete model:\n\nWrite the complete model for price as a function of hour (0-24):\n\n\n\n\nDecision time: Your EV needs 4 hours to charge and uses about 10 kWh. According to your model, approximately how much would it cost to charge starting at midnight vs. starting at 5 PM?\n\n\n\n\nModel validity: In reality, most power companies use step changes (e.g., “off-peak” from 9 PM to 7 AM at $0.10, “peak” from 4 PM to 9 PM at $0.30) rather than continuously varying rates. Does this information significantly change the validity of your model for making decisions about when to run appliances? Explain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 6 Chemical Spill Response\nA tanker truck accident has spilled industrial solvent into a municipal reservoir. The city immediately shut off water supply and began monitoring contamination levels.\nThe EPA safe limit for this chemical is 5 parts per million (ppm). Initial readings show a concentration of 80 ppm. The chemical degrades through a combination of natural processes: volatilization (evaporation), photolysis (breakdown by sunlight), and dilution from incoming fresh water.\nEnvironmental engineers take measurements over the following weeks:\n\n\n\nDays after spill\nConcentration (ppm)\n\n\n\n\n0\n80\n\n\n7\n40\n\n\n14\n20\n\n\n21\n10\n\n\n\nThe city council needs to know: When will the water be safe to drink?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour task: Build a model for contamination level (in ppm) as a function of days since the spill, then use it to answer the city’s question.\nYour model:\nWrite a formula for concentration C as a function of days d:\n\n\nThe decision:\nAccording to your model, on what day will the concentration first drop below the 5 ppm safety threshold? Show your reasoning.\n\n\nReflection:\nThe mayor wants to announce a reopening date to the public. What date would you advise, and why might you recommend waiting longer than what your model strictly predicts? Consider factors like measurement uncertainty, model limitations, and the consequences of being wrong."

    "text": "At the University of Austin, our students pursue a Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Studies. As part of their required course of study, students must complete a core curriculum called the Intellectual Foundations, which consists of 15 intensive courses that introduce students to the various languages of understanding and teach them to see things whole. As part of this sequence, students are challenged to confront timeless questions beginning in antiquity and culminating in the present day.\nThere are two quantitative reasoning courses in the Intellectual Foundation curriculum. These are:\n\nQuantitative Reasoning I (“QR — Analysis”), which teaches students the mathematical modeling tools useful for modelling real-world phenomena.\nQuantitative Reasoning II (“QR — Data”), which teaches students to extract useful information from data using modern data science techniques.\n\nBoth QR — Analysis and QR — Data are unlike the introductory courses found at almost all other colleges and universities. We have selected topics based on their utility in modern professional work. In contrast, basic topics in the traditional curriculum reflect the historical development of mathematics rather than the needs of modern work. Modern topics widely used in the economy and scientific/technical worlds are relegated to so-called “advanced” courses far downstream where they are inaccessible to almost all students.\nOur two QR courses dramatically streamline the pre-requisites for successful work with modern quantitative topics. Surprisingly often the “advanced” topics are readily accessible to students, so long as one is willing to move beyond traditional pedagogy and avoid unwarranted devotion to topics that were important historically but are no longer necessarily for understanding.",

The benchmark figure is how many watts per kilo a cyclist can sustain for a one-hour effort. Every rider now has a power meter fitted to their bike, so they know their numbers in a constant, real-time way (together with heart rate, speed, and other measurements).\n\nThe article describes the then-current leader in the Tour de France as having a power-to-weight ratio of seven watts per kilogram.\n\nIf this rider weighs 70 kg, how many watts can he generate?\n\n\n sbk-1-vsw\n\n   49 watts        70 watts        490 watts        700 watts         \n\n\n\n\n\nLook up the conversion factor from watts to horsepower. How many horsepower is the rider generating?\n\n\n sbk-2-ie2d\n\n   0.066 hp        0.660 hp        6.60 hp        66.0 hp         \n\n\n\n\n\nA horse weighing 500 kg can generate one horsepower while walking. How does the horse’s power efficiency per weight compare to the champion bike rider.\n\n\n sbk-3-r7f\n\n\n Horse 7 W/kg versus human 1.4 W/kg\n\n\n Human 7 W/kg versus horse 1.4 W/kg\n\n\n Human 7 W/kg versus horse 2.8 W/kg\n\n\n Horse 70 W/kg versus human 280 W/kg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no conversion factor from watts to calories. Why not?\n\n\n sbk-4-ri3\n\n\n One is metric units, the other is “traditional” units.\n\n\n You can’t compare light-bulbs to food!\n\n\n They have different dimensions.\n\n\n That’s wrong. There is a conversion factor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook up the conversion factor from watt-seconds to kilo-calories (kcal (or “Cal”), the relevant unit when looking at diet). How many kcal does the rider produce when biking for one hour at 7 w/kg?\n\n\n sbk-5-nsl2\n\n   211 kcal        422 kcal        633 kcal        844 kcal        1688 kcal         \n\n\n\n\n1 watt-second is 0.000239006 kcal. In an hour, the rider generates 3600 s times 70 kg times 7 w/kg = 422 kcal\n\nIt’s estimated that a person’s efficiency when converting dietary calories to work/movement calories is about 25%. In an hour of biking at 7 w/kg, how many dietary calories does a 70-kg rider consume?\n\n\n sbk-6-fjfk\n\n   211 kcal        422 kcal        633 kcal        844 kcal        1688 kcal         \n\n\n\n\n\nAn “average” adult walking at 2.5 mi/hr is said to use about 150 watts of power. For this hypothetical adult, how much energy is consumed in a 1-hour walk?\n\n\n sbk-7-fjfk\n\n   130 Cal        260 Cal        1.5 Wh        15 Wh         \n\n\n\n\n\nIn the exercise/diet literature it’s said that walking a mile consumes about 100 kcal.\n\n    sbk-8-ywr\n\n   True     or        False         \n\n\n This is (roughly) consistent with the 150 watts of power claimed when waking at 2.5 mi/hr.\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe three temperature scales—C, F, and K—define zero degrees differently. This make it hard to do the conversion in one’s head.\nThe computational chunk that follows provides two functions, FtoC() and FtoK()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the change in C when F increases by 10 degrees?\n\n\n dfs-1-is4\n\n   0.556 degrees        5.56 degrees C        -5.56 degrees C        5.56 degrees F         \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the rate of change of C with respect to F?\n\n\n dfs-2-krod\n\n\n 0.556 degrees C\n\n\n 1.8 degrees C\n\n\n 0.556 degrees C / degrees F\n\n\n 1.8 degrees C / degrees F\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the dimension of the rate of change of C with respect to F?\n\n\n dfs-3-owe\n\n\n dimensionless\n\n\n 𝛳\n\n\n 𝛳-1\n\n\n 𝛳-2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteDrill for Chapter 4\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen drill questions in this document\nRemember to submit your drill answers through that document.

For instance, we can graph engine RPM (revolutions per second) versus engine mass (in pounds), as in Figure 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Engine speed (RPM) versus mass for 39 different engines using linear axes. Applications for engines span many magnitudes: compare a small lawn-mower engine to the huge engine in a large ship.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Figure 2, most engines have a mass of… zero. At least, that is how it appears. The scale of the horizontal axis is determined only by the two massive 100,000-pound monster engines plotted at the right end of the graph.\nPlotting the magnitude of the engine mass spreads things out, as in Figure 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: The engine data plotted with magnitude scales\n\n\n\n\nWhich of the plots in Figure 3 uses two magnitude axes?\n\n\n zdb-1-8dw\n\n   (a)        (b)        both a and b        neither a nor b         \n\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 3, there is an unlabelled vertical grid line half-way between 100 and 10,000 pounds.

Identify one and write briefly about which possible input quantities you were ambivalent about and whence stems your ambivalence. Or, pick one of the quantities and explain which other quantities you regarded as an input.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2 Consider an everyday kind of question: Which is more to blame for discomfort in hot weather, the temperature or the humidity?\nThe blame question makes sense only if we think that humidity and temperature have something to do with comfort. Everyday experience strongly suggests that they do. For quantitative understanding, we can translate “something to do with …” into a mathematical framework: that comfort is a function of humidity and temperature. Functions are not the only way to represent the idea of “something to do with,” but experience has shown that they are powerful ways to do so. Knowing how functions are constructed and how to extract information from them is an essential component of quantitative analysis.\nIn Steadman’s model, sultriness is constructed as a function of temperature and relative humidity. That is, the inputs to the function are temperature and humidity. The output is sultriness. You can calculate the sultriness corresponding to the values of the inputs in Figure 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInputs:\n\nviewof temp = Inputs.range(\n  [20, 50],\n  {value: 35, step: 0.1, label: \"Temperature (deg C)\"}\n)\n\nviewof humid = Inputs.range(\n  [0, 100],\n  {value: 55, step: 1, label: \"Humidity (%)\"}\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The sultriness function. Set the inputs with the sliders and the corresponding output is shown below.\n\n\n\nFigure 1 shows three values. When you change the inputs, the output changes accordingly. That is the characteristic of a function. The presentation in Figure 1 is adequate for someone who wants to compute the sultriness for given weather conditions. We gain more insight into sultriness if we present the output of the function for many different sets of inputs. Steadman’s paper displayed the function as a printed table, which was the only practical way of communicating such a complicated function in 1979 (that is, before the widespread availability of calculators or computers).\n\n\nAre there any temperature/humidity combinations at which the output temperature (that is, the sultriness index) is lower than the input ambient temperature?     gcb-1-kwe\n\n   True     or        False         \n\n\n\nAt an input temperature of 37 C (that is, body temperature) what is the highest humidity level for which the inputs are in bounds?\n\n\n gcb-2-e4kf\n\n   60        62        64        65         \n\n\n\n\n\nSet the inputs to 37 degrees C and zero humidity.

At 0% humidity, there is some input temperature where the output temperature is greater than the input.     gcb-3b-2se\n\n   True     or        False         \n\n\n\n3c.

The output will be 15 deg C. Now raise the input temperature slowly. Use the up-and-down triangles in the box showing the input temperature, so that you can change temperature by 0.1 deg C each click.\n\n5a. How many clicks are required to raise the output temperature to 16 deg C?\n\n gcb-5a-oeie\n\n   4        5        6        7         \n\n\n\n\n5b.

They are easily constructed with a computer. For our purposes, we use a package called {mosaicCalc} which provides several utilities for making graphics. To make a graph of a function with one input, you will need three pieces of information:\n\nWhat is the function you want to graph?\nWhat name you want to use for the input to the function?\nWhat graphics domain you want to show in the graph?\n\nThe command to use in R/mosaic is slice_plot(). It takes two arguments. For demonstration purposes, we’ll plot the hillside() function, using z as the name of the input and displaying the graph over the domain from -4 to 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first argument is called a ☞ tilde expression ☜, the name of which comes from the character ~. Put the input name to be used on the right side of the tilde. On the left size, give an R expression for the function you want to graph (hillside) as well as the input name to use: hillside(z).\nThe second argument always looks like domain(z = -4:5), but of course you need to substitute in your input name and the lower and upper bounds that define the graphics domain. These are formatted using a colon to separate the lower from the upper bound.\nYou are welcome to place the whole command on one line. We’ve used multiple lines so that there is space for a # comment that describes the line. (You don’t need to do this.)\nFor each of the following item, put the appropriate command in the R chunk, verify that it works, and copy the command to the text-entry box. There will be one line in the text-entry box for each. Please keep them in order.\n\nPlot osc() using t as the input name with the graphics domain extending from zero to five.\nPlot hill() using z as the input name. The graphics domain should go from -3 to 3.\nPlot doublings() using fish as the input name. The graphics domain is zero to three.\nPlot osc() * hill() using x as the input name. The graphics domain is -4 to 4. (Hint: The x will appear altogether three times in the tilde expression.)\n\nIn the textbox, put your answers to each of (a) - (d) on a separate line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4 We have defined for your convenience several one-input functions named f1() through f5(). Graph each of them, one at a time, on the domain -5 to 5 and, from the graph, read off the requested information. (Hint: All you need is the name of the function, you don’t have to worry about how we constructed it.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor f1(), for what input does the output reach its maximum value? (Select the closest value.)\n\n\n gmc-1-lesle\n\n   -4        -3        -2        0        2        3        4         \n\n\n\n\n\nFor f2(), what is the input where the output crosses zero? [Pick the closest answer.]\n\n\n gmc-2-loie\n\n   -3        -1        0        1        3         \n\n\n\n\n\nFor f3(), what is the minimum value of the output? [Pick the closest answer.]\n\n\n gmc-3-yee\n\n   0        -10        -20        -30         \n\n\n\n\n\nFor f4(), at what input does the output cross zero? [Pick the closest answer.]\n\n\n gmc-4-rwsle\n\n   -4        -3        -2        0        2        3        4         \n\n\n\n\n\nFor f5(), at how many different inputs does the output cross zero?\n\n\n gmc-5-qdr\n\n   0        1        2        3        4         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5 Consider this plot of the hillside function:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\n\n\nWhat R function is being used to make the plot?\n\n\n dek-1-gmek\n\n   plot()        slice_plot()        plotfun()        sliceplot()        plot_fun()         \n\n\n\n\n\nImmediately following the name of the function, there is an opening parenthesis. The matching closing parenthesis is at the very end of the command. In R (as in many computer languages) the arguments to the function are contained inside the parentheses. If there is more than one argument, successive arguments are separated by commas. How many arguments are there to slice_plot()?\n\n\n dek-2-z38d\n\n   1        2        3        4         \n\n\n\n\nThe first argument to slice_plot() tells which function you want to graph. In the example, the first argument is hillside(z) ~ z. This is called a ☞ tilde expression ☜ so named because the tilde character (~) appears.\n\n\n\nLeft\nMiddle\nRight\n\n\n\n\nhillside(z)\n~ (tilde)\nz\n\n\n\n\nThe left part of the tilde expression is a formula written in more or less conventional algebraic form. Other examples for this formula: 2*z + 3, osc(z), hillside(z) * osc(z).\nThe right part of the tilde expression gives the name of the input variable. In the example, the name is z, but you can use whatever name you think appropriate. Note that the formula in (i) must be written in terms of the input-variable name.\nThe middle part of the tilde expression is merely punctuation, but it is essential punctuation. Among other things, the tilde makes clear what are the left and right sides of the tilde expression.\n\n\nSuppose that you want to call the input quantity x. You can easily modify the command to do this, just substitute x for z. In how many places do you have to make the change?\n\n\n dek-3-jwkd\n\n   1        2        3        4         \n\n\n\n\nFocus now on the graphic itself—Figure 2. The name of the input variable appears as a label on the horizontal axis. The label on the vertical axis, in contrast, is just a reminder that we are plotting the output of the function versus the input quantity.\nThe vertical scale will be created automatically by slice_plot(), taking into account the range of function output values. But the horizontal axis is different: the user specifies this. The numerical extent of the horizontal axis is called the graphics domain.\nThe second argument to slice_plot() is used for the graphics domain specification.\n\nWhat is the graphics domain in Figure 2?\n\n\n dek-4-p3n2\n\n   0 to 4        -2 to 2        -2 to 4        -4 to 4         \n\n\n\n\nIn the example, the second argument is domain(z = -2:4). The graphics domain specification will always look like this, and uses the R function domain().\n\nHow many arguments does domain() take in this example?\n\n\n dek-4-7s2r\n\n   0        1        2        3         \n\n\n\n\nThere are two punctuation symbols in the argument to domain(). The colon (:) is placed between the two limits to be used for the domain. -2:4 means “minus 2 to 4.” The graphics domain zero to ten would be 0:10. The other punctuation mark is =. To the left of the = goes the name of the input variable. The expression z = -2:4 means “the graphics domain of z is to be -2 to 4.\n\nUsing the “graphing a function” interactive R chunk, write an expression to plot out the function osc() over the graphics domain 0 to 5. Use whatever you like as the input name. After checking that your expression works, copy the expression into the following answer block.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 6 The slice_plot() function (see Exercise 3) produces the graph of a function with one input. Convention calls for the input to correspond to the horizontal axis and the output to the vertical axis.\nFor functions with two inputs, the input corresponds to the points in a two-dimensional space. That is, each possible input is a coordinate pair. To graphically represent each possible input uniquely, we need to use both the horizontal and vertical axes, one for the first input and the other for the second input. Where, then, to show the output.\nOur preferred graphical format for functions of two inputs is called a ☞ contour plot ☜. The R chunk below shows the R/mosaic code to generate a plot. Run the chunk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis R expression follows a similar form to that used for slice_plot(). Notice, however, that the tilde expression used in the first argument names both inputs: x & y on the right-hand side of the tilde. Likewise, the definition of the graphics domain involves two components, one for each of the inputs.\nIt takes some practice to get comfortable reading contour plots. The labels along each blue ☞ contour ☜ specify the output for any input that lies on the contour.\nIn principle, each possible input point has some contour line running through it. This is the same as saying that for each input, say, (x=1, y=2), the function has an output value. But if we drew a contour for every output value, the graph would be filled with blue ink and incomprehensible. To avoid this problem, only a handful of contours are drawn. Also, to avoid cluttering up the graph with output value labels, the contour_plot() R function labels only every second contour. The output value for the unlabeled contours are half-way in-between the output values for the two labeled contours that run side-by-side with the unlabeled one.\nTo illustrate, the input point (x=1, y=2) falls about half-way between the contour labeled 0.6 and the unlabeled contour corresponding to output value 0.4. Since the input point is located between the 0.4 and 0.6 contours, the corresponding output will be approximately 0.5.\nIn this book, we won’t dwell on teaching the syntax of the contour_plot() function. When we need it, we will give you a template so that you just have to fill in the details: the names of the two inputs, the function itself, and the extent of the graphics domain along each axis.\nFor now, we’ll practice how to read off the output for any given input. Consider Figure 3, which displays a function \\(f(x,y)\\) we have made up for the example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3\n\n\n\n\n\nFor each of the five distinct input points labeled (a) to (e), give a good estimate of the corresponding output."
