Everyday experience strongly suggests that they do. For quantitative understanding, we can translate “something to do with …” into a mathematical framework: that comfort is a function of humidity and temperature. Functions are not the only way to represent the idea of “something to do with,” but experience has shown that they are powerful ways to do so. Knowing how functions are constructed and how to extract information from them is an essential component of quantitative analysis.\nIn Steadman’s model, sultriness is constructed as a function of temperature and relative humidity. That is, the inputs to the function are temperature and humidity. The output is sultriness. You can calculate the sultriness corresponding to the values of the inputs in Figure 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInputs:\n\nviewof temp = Inputs.range(\n  [20, 50],\n  {value: 35, step: 0.1, label: \"Temperature (deg C)\"}\n)\n\nviewof humid = Inputs.range(\n  [0, 100],\n  {value: 55, step: 1, label: \"Humidity (%)\"}\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The sultriness function. Set the inputs with the sliders and the corresponding output is shown below.\n\n\n\nFigure 1 shows three values. When you change the inputs, the output changes accordingly. That is the characteristic of a function. The presentation in Figure 1 is adequate for someone who wants to compute the sultriness for given weather conditions. We gain more insight into sultriness if we present the output of the function for many different sets of inputs. Steadman’s paper displayed the function as a printed table, which was the only practical way of communicating such a complicated function in 1979 (that is, before the widespread availability of calculators or computers).\n\n\nAre there any temperature/humidity combinations at which the output temperature (that is, the sultriness index) is lower than the input ambient temperature?     gcb-1-kwe\n\n   True     or        False         \n\n\n\nAt an input temperature of 37 C (that is, body temperature) what is the highest humidity level for which the inputs are in bounds?\n\n\n gcb-2-e4kf\n\n   60        62        64        65         \n\n\n\n\n\nSet the inputs to 37 degrees C and zero humidity.

They are easily constructed with a computer. For our purposes, we use a package called {mosaicCalc} which provides several utilities for making graphics. To make a graph of a function with one input, you will need three pieces of information:\n\nWhat is the function you want to graph?\nWhat name you want to use for the input to the function?\nWhat graphics domain you want to show in the graph?\n\nThe command to use in R/mosaic is slice_plot(). It takes two arguments. For demonstration purposes, we’ll plot the hillside() function, using z as the name of the input and displaying the graph over the domain from -4 to 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first argument is called a ☞ tilde expression ☜, the name of which comes from the character ~. Put the input name to be used on the right side of the tilde. On the left size, give an R expression for the function you want to graph (hillside) as well as the input name to use: hillside(z).\nThe second argument always looks like domain(z = -4:5), but of course you need to substitute in your input name and the lower and upper bounds that define the graphics domain. These are formatted using a colon to separate the lower from the upper bound.\nYou are welcome to place the whole command on one line. We’ve used multiple lines so that there is space for a # comment that describes the line. (You don’t need to do this.)\nFor each of the following item, put the appropriate command in the R chunk, verify that it works, and copy the command to the text-entry box. There will be one line in the text-entry box for each. Please keep them in order.\n\nPlot osc() using t as the input name with the graphics domain extending from zero to five.\nPlot hill() using z as the input name. The graphics domain should go from -3 to 3.\nPlot doublings() using fish as the input name. The graphics domain is zero to three.\nPlot osc() * hill() using x as the input name. The graphics domain is -4 to 4. (Hint: The x will appear altogether three times in the tilde expression.)\n\nIn the textbox, put your answers to each of (a) - (d) on a separate line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4 We have defined for your convenience several one-input functions named f1() through f5(). Graph each of them, one at a time, on the domain -5 to 5 and, from the graph, read off the requested information. (Hint: All you need is the name of the function, you don’t have to worry about how we constructed it.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor f1(), for what input does the output reach its maximum value? (Select the closest value.)\n\n\n gmc-1-lesle\n\n   -4        -3        -2        0        2        3        4         \n\n\n\n\n\nFor f2(), what is the input where the output crosses zero? [Pick the closest answer.]\n\n\n gmc-2-loie\n\n   -3        -1        0        1        3         \n\n\n\n\n\nFor f3(), what is the minimum value of the output? [Pick the closest answer.]\n\n\n gmc-3-yee\n\n   0        -10        -20        -30         \n\n\n\n\n\nFor f4(), at what input does the output cross zero? [Pick the closest answer.]\n\n\n gmc-4-rwsle\n\n   -4        -3        -2        0        2        3        4         \n\n\n\n\n\nFor f5(), at how many different inputs does the output cross zero?\n\n\n gmc-5-qdr\n\n   0        1        2        3        4         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5 Consider this plot of the hillside function:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\n\n\nWhat R function is being used to make the plot?\n\n\n dek-1-gmek\n\n   plot()        slice_plot()        plotfun()        sliceplot()        plot_fun()         \n\n\n\n\n\nImmediately following the name of the function, there is an opening parenthesis. The matching closing parenthesis is at the very end of the command. In R (as in many computer languages) the arguments to the function are contained inside the parentheses. If there is more than one argument, successive arguments are separated by commas. How many arguments are there to slice_plot()?\n\n\n dek-2-z38d\n\n   1        2        3        4         \n\n\n\n\nThe first argument to slice_plot() tells which function you want to graph. In the example, the first argument is hillside(z) ~ z. This is called a ☞ tilde expression ☜ so named because the tilde character (~) appears.\n\n\n\nLeft\nMiddle\nRight\n\n\n\n\nhillside(z)\n~ (tilde)\nz\n\n\n\n\nThe left part of the tilde expression is a formula written in more or less conventional algebraic form. Other examples for this formula: 2*z + 3, osc(z), hillside(z) * osc(z).\nThe right part of the tilde expression gives the name of the input variable. In the example, the name is z, but you can use whatever name you think appropriate. Note that the formula in (i) must be written in terms of the input-variable name.\nThe middle part of the tilde expression is merely punctuation, but it is essential punctuation. Among other things, the tilde makes clear what are the left and right sides of the tilde expression.\n\n\nSuppose that you want to call the input quantity x. You can easily modify the command to do this, just substitute x for z. In how many places do you have to make the change?\n\n\n dek-3-jwkd\n\n   1        2        3        4         \n\n\n\n\nFocus now on the graphic itself—Figure 2. The name of the input variable appears as a label on the horizontal axis. The label on the vertical axis, in contrast, is just a reminder that we are plotting the output of the function versus the input quantity.\nThe vertical scale will be created automatically by slice_plot(), taking into account the range of function output values. But the horizontal axis is different: the user specifies this. The numerical extent of the horizontal axis is called the graphics domain.\nThe second argument to slice_plot() is used for the graphics domain specification.\n\nWhat is the graphics domain in Figure 2?\n\n\n dek-4-p3n2\n\n   0 to 4        -2 to 2        -2 to 4        -4 to 4         \n\n\n\n\nIn the example, the second argument is domain(z = -2:4). The graphics domain specification will always look like this, and uses the R function domain().\n\nHow many arguments does domain() take in this example?\n\n\n dek-4-7s2r\n\n   0        1        2        3         \n\n\n\n\nThere are two punctuation symbols in the argument to domain(). The colon (:) is placed between the two limits to be used for the domain. -2:4 means “minus 2 to 4.” The graphics domain zero to ten would be 0:10. The other punctuation mark is =. To the left of the = goes the name of the input variable. The expression z = -2:4 means “the graphics domain of z is to be -2 to 4.\n\nUsing the “graphing a function” interactive R chunk, write an expression to plot out the function osc() over the graphics domain 0 to 5. Use whatever you like as the input name. After checking that your expression works, copy the expression into the following answer block.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 6 The slice_plot() function (see Exercise 3) produces the graph of a function with one input. Convention calls for the input to correspond to the horizontal axis and the output to the vertical axis.\nFor functions with two inputs, the input corresponds to the points in a two-dimensional space. That is, each possible input is a coordinate pair. To graphically represent each possible input uniquely, we need to use both the horizontal and vertical axes, one for the first input and the other for the second input. Where, then, to show the output.\nOur preferred graphical format for functions of two inputs is called a ☞ contour plot ☜. The R chunk below shows the R/mosaic code to generate a plot. Run the chunk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis R expression follows a similar form to that used for slice_plot(). Notice, however, that the tilde expression used in the first argument names both inputs: x & y on the right-hand side of the tilde. Likewise, the definition of the graphics domain involves two components, one for each of the inputs.\nIt takes some practice to get comfortable reading contour plots. The labels along each blue ☞ contour ☜ specify the output for any input that lies on the contour.\nIn principle, each possible input point has some contour line running through it. This is the same as saying that for each input, say, (x=1, y=2), the function has an output value. But if we drew a contour for every output value, the graph would be filled with blue ink and incomprehensible. To avoid this problem, only a handful of contours are drawn. Also, to avoid cluttering up the graph with output value labels, the contour_plot() R function labels only every second contour. The output value for the unlabeled contours are half-way in-between the output values for the two labeled contours that run side-by-side with the unlabeled one.\nTo illustrate, the input point (x=1, y=2) falls about half-way between the contour labeled 0.6 and the unlabeled contour corresponding to output value 0.4. Since the input point is located between the 0.4 and 0.6 contours, the corresponding output will be approximately 0.5.\nIn this book, we won’t dwell on teaching the syntax of the contour_plot() function. When we need it, we will give you a template so that you just have to fill in the details: the names of the two inputs, the function itself, and the extent of the graphics domain along each axis.\nFor now, we’ll practice how to read off the output for any given input. Consider Figure 3, which displays a function \\(f(x,y)\\) we have made up for the example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3\n\n\n\n\n\nFor each of the five distinct input points labeled (a) to (e), give a good estimate of the corresponding output."

    "text": "At the University of Austin, our students pursue a Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Studies. As part of their required course of study, students must complete a core curriculum called the Intellectual Foundations, which consists of 15 intensive courses that introduce students to the various languages of understanding and teach them to see things whole. As part of this sequence, students are challenged to confront timeless questions beginning in antiquity and culminating in the present day.\nThere are two quantitative reasoning courses in the Intellectual Foundation curriculum. These are:\n\nQuantitative Reasoning I (“QR — Analysis”), which teaches students the mathematical modeling tools useful for modelling real-world phenomena.\nQuantitative Reasoning II (“QR — Data”), which teaches students to extract useful information from data using modern data science techniques.\n\nBoth QR — Analysis and QR — Data are unlike the introductory courses found at almost all other colleges and universities. We have selected topics based on their utility in modern professional work. In contrast, basic topics in the traditional curriculum reflect the historical development of mathematics rather than the needs of modern work. Modern topics widely used in the economy and scientific/technical worlds are relegated to so-called “advanced” courses far downstream where they are inaccessible to almost all students.\nOur two QR courses dramatically streamline the pre-requisites for successful work with modern quantitative topics. Surprisingly often the “advanced” topics are readily accessible to students, so long as one is willing to move beyond traditional pedagogy and avoid unwarranted devotion to topics that were important historically but are no longer necessarily for understanding.",

The benchmark figure is how many watts per kilo a cyclist can sustain for a one-hour effort. Every rider now has a power meter fitted to their bike, so they know their numbers in a constant, real-time way (together with heart rate, speed, and other measurements).\n\nThe article describes the then-current leader in the Tour de France as having a power-to-weight ratio of seven watts per kilogram.\n\nIf this rider weighs 70 kg, how many watts can he generate?\n\n\n sbk-1-vsw\n\n   49 watts        70 watts        490 watts        700 watts         \n\n\n\n\n\nLook up the conversion factor from watts to horsepower. How many horsepower is the rider generating?\n\n\n sbk-2-ie2d\n\n   0.066 hp        0.660 hp        6.60 hp        66.0 hp         \n\n\n\n\n\nA horse weighing 500 kg can generate one horsepower while walking. How does the horse’s power efficiency per weight compare to the champion bike rider.\n\n\n sbk-3-r7f\n\n\n Horse 7 W/kg versus human 1.4 W/kg\n\n\n Human 7 W/kg versus horse 1.4 W/kg\n\n\n Human 7 W/kg versus horse 2.8 W/kg\n\n\n Horse 70 W/kg versus human 280 W/kg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no conversion factor from watts to calories. Why not?\n\n\n sbk-4-ri3\n\n\n One is metric units, the other is “traditional” units.\n\n\n You can’t compare light-bulbs to food!\n\n\n They have different dimensions.\n\n\n That’s wrong. There is a conversion factor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook up the conversion factor from watt-seconds to kilo-calories (kcal (or “Cal”), the relevant unit when looking at diet). How many kcal does the rider produce when biking for one hour at 7 w/kg?\n\n\n sbk-5-nsl2\n\n   211 kcal        422 kcal        633 kcal        844 kcal        1688 kcal         \n\n\n\n\n1 watt-second is 0.000239006 kcal. In an hour, the rider generates 3600 s times 70 kg times 7 w/kg = 422 kcal\n\nIt’s estimated that a person’s efficiency when converting dietary calories to work/movement calories is about 25%.

For instance, we can graph engine RPM (revolutions per second) versus engine mass (in pounds), as in Figure 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Engine speed (RPM) versus mass for 39 different engines using linear axes. Applications for engines span many magnitudes: compare a small lawn-mower engine to the huge engine in a large ship.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Figure 2, most engines have a mass of… zero. At least, that is how it appears. The scale of the horizontal axis is determined only by the two massive 100,000-pound monster engines plotted at the right end of the graph.\nPlotting the magnitude of the engine mass spreads things out, as in Figure 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: The engine data plotted with magnitude scales\n\n\n\n\nWhich of the plots in Figure 3 uses two magnitude axes?\n\n\n zdb-1-8dw\n\n   (a)        (b)        both a and b        neither a nor b         \n\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 3, there is an unlabelled vertical grid line half-way between 100 and 10,000 pounds.
