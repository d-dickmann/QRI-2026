## Remember to hand in your work!

Much of your work for the class will take the form of completing interactive web documents. Near the top of each such document, there is a highlighted box very similar to this on. To hand in your work, open that box and press **"Collect your answers"**. This will copy your essay and multiple-choice answers to your clipboard, in preparation for uploading them to the course's collection site.

After pressing **"Collect your answers"* to the the follow the [link to upload site](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfh2aEmMwgBA__bl_uTYZl9NjUTLBhzC25qEYHSnwXXWhDqoQ/viewform?usp=header). This leads to a Google form providing space for your email address and for pasting your answers from the clipboard. The same link will be used for the entire course.

Finally, press the "Submit" button on the Google form. Done!

## More details about the submission process ...

Please do not edit the clipboard string. It's intended for computer-to-computer communication and will look something like this.

```
{"docid":"One-minute.rmarkdown","MC":[],"Essays":[{"itemid":"1-min-week1-a","contents":"The class was great!"},{"itemid":"1-min-week1-b","contents":"Even better today!"}}
```

There may be many empty fields in the string; that is as it should be.

So long as you are using the same browser on the same computer, your answers will continue to appear in the web document each time you open it. (DON'T CONFUSE THIS with submitting your work. For us to receive it, it has to be submitted via the Google form.) You can go back to the web document whenever you like. So feel free to do your work in stages, perhaps spread over a couple of days. 

When in doubt whether your work has been submitted, submit it again! The computerized collection system will take care of any duplications.
