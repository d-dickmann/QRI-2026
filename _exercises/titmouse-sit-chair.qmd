Graphs of a function of one input, as in `r xf("fig-payment-r-slice")`, are familiar to many students from high school math courses. They are easily constructed with a computer. For our purposes, we use a package called `{mosaicCalc}` which provides several utilities for making graphics. To make a graph of a function with one input, you will need three pieces of information:

i. What is the function you want to graph?
ii. What name you want to use for the input to the function?
iii. What graphics domain you want to show in the graph?

The command to use in R/mosaic is `slice_plot()`. It takes two arguments. For demonstration purposes, we'll plot the `hillside()` function, using `z` as the name of the input and displaying the graph over the domain from -4 to 5. 

```{webr}
#| caption: Intro to slice_plot()
slice_plot(          # The R function to use
  hillside(z) ~ z,   # first argument
  domain(z = -4:5)   # second argument
)
```

The first argument is called a `r xf_definition("tilde expression")`, the name of which comes from the character [`~`]{style="font-size: 20;"}. Put the input name to be used on the right side of the tilde. On the left size, give an R expression for the function you want to graph (`hillside`) as well as the input name to use: `hillside(z)`.

The second argument *always* looks like `domain(z = -4:5)`, but of course you need to substitute in your input name and the lower and upper bounds that define the graphics domain. These are formatted using a colon to separate the lower from the upper bound.

You are welcome to place the whole command on one line. We've used multiple lines so that there is space for a `# comment` that describes the line. (You don't need to do this.)

For each of the following item, put the appropriate command in the R chunk, verify that it works, and copy the command to the text-entry box. There will be one line in the text-entry box for each. Please keep them in order.

a. Plot `osc()` using `t` as the input name with the graphics domain extending from zero to five.
b. Plot `hill()` using `z` as the input name. The graphics domain should go from -3 to 3.
c. Plot `doublings()` using `fish` as the input name. The graphics domain is zero to three.
d. Plot `osc() * hill()` using `x` as the input name. The graphics domain is -4 to 4. (Hint: The `x` will appear altogether *three* times in the tilde expression.)

In the textbox, put your answers to each of (a) - (d) on a separate line.
