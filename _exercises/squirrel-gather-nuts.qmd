Both `recip(x)` and `double(-x)` produce outputs that *decrease* as the input increases. But they model fundamentally different processes. This exercise will help you discover the difference.

**Scenario A — Sharing Pizza**

A pizza has 24 slices. The more people who share it, the fewer slices each person gets.

| People | Slices per person |
|--------|-------------------|
| 1      | 24                |
| 2      | 12                |
| 3      | 8                 |
| 4      | 6                 |
| 6      | 4                 |
| 8      | 3                 |

**Scenario B — Radioactive Decay**

A sample starts with 100 grams of a radioactive isotope. Each year, exactly half of the remaining material decays.

| Years passed | Grams remaining |
|--------------|-----------------|
| 0            | 100             |
| 1            | 50              |
| 2            | 25              |
| 3            | 12.5            |
| 4            | 6.25            |

**Part 1: Noticing the Pattern**

1. In Scenario A (pizza), if the number of people *doubles* from 3 to 6, what happens to slices per person?

```{mcq}
#| label: sgn-pizza-double
#| inline: true
1. It doubles
2. It is cut in half [correct]
3. It decreases by 4
4. It stays the same
```

2. In Scenario A (pizza), if the number of people increases by 1 (from 3 to 4), what happens to slices per person?

```{mcq}
#| label: sgn-pizza-add-one
#| inline: true
1. It is cut in half
2. It decreases by 2 [correct]
3. It decreases by a factor of 4/3
4. It stays the same
```

3. In Scenario B (radioactive decay), if you wait *one more year* (from year 2 to year 3), what happens to the amount remaining?

```{mcq}
#| label: sgn-decay-one-more
#| inline: true
1. It doubles
2. It is cut in half [correct]
3. It decreases by 12.5
4. It decreases by 25
```

4. In Scenario B (radioactive decay), if you wait *two more years* (from year 1 to year 3), what happens to the amount remaining?

```{mcq}
#| label: sgn-decay-two-more
#| inline: true
1. It is cut in half
2. It is cut to one quarter [correct]
3. It decreases by 37.5
4. It is cut to one third
```

**Part 2: The Key Distinction**

5. In Scenario A, what causes the output to be cut in half?

```{mcq}
#| label: sgn-trigger-a
1. Doubling the input [correct]
2. Adding 1 to the input
3. Waiting one time period
4. Subtracting half from the output
```

6. In Scenario B, what causes the output to be cut in half?

```{mcq}
#| label: sgn-trigger-b
1. Doubling the input
2. Adding 1 to the input [correct]
3. Multiplying the input by itself
4. Subtracting half from the output
```

```{webr}
#| caption: Explore both scenarios

```

7. Which statement best captures the difference between `recip` and `double(-x)`?

```{mcq}
#| label: sgn-key-difference
1. recip decreases and double(-x) increases
2. recip is for small numbers, double(-x) is for large numbers
3. recip: "doubling input halves output" vs double(-x): "each unit of input halves output" [correct]
4. They are mathematically the same function
```

**Part 3: Apply Your Understanding**

For each scenario, decide which type of relationship it represents.

8. **Splitting a bill**: If 3 friends split a $90 bill, each pays $30. If 6 friends split it, each pays $15.

```{mcq}
#| label: sgn-apply-bill
#| inline: true
1. recip [correct]
2. double(-x)
```

9. **Medicine metabolism**: A drug's concentration drops by half every 4 hours.

```{mcq}
#| label: sgn-apply-medicine
#| inline: true
1. recip
2. double(-x) [correct]
```

10. **Travel time**: Driving 120 miles at 30 mph takes 4 hours. At 60 mph it takes 2 hours. At 120 mph it takes 1 hour.

```{mcq}
#| label: sgn-apply-travel
#| inline: true
1. recip [correct]
2. double(-x)
```

11. **Depreciation**: A car loses 15% of its current value each year.

```{mcq}
#| label: sgn-apply-depreciation
#| inline: true
1. recip
2. double(-x) [correct]
```

12. **Resolution**: A printer's ink cartridge can print 1000 pages. If you print 250 photos (each uses 4 pages worth of ink), you can print 0 photos. But if you print smaller photos using 2 pages of ink each, you can print 500.

```{mcq}
#| label: sgn-apply-printer
#| inline: true
1. recip [correct]
2. double(-x)
```
