Both `recip(x)` and `double(-x)` produce outputs that *decrease* as the input increases. But they model fundamentally different processes. This exercise will help you discover the difference.

**Scenario A — Sharing Pizza**

A pizza has 8 slices. The more people who share it, the fewer slices each person gets.

| People | Slices per person |
|--------|-------------------|
| 1      | 8                 |
| 2      | 4                 |
| 4      | 2                 |
| 8      | 1                 |

**Scenario B — Lily Pad Die-Off**

A pond starts with 8 lily pads. Each winter, exactly half of the lily pads die.

| Winters passed | Lily pads remaining |
|----------------|---------------------|
| 0              | 8                   |
| 1              | 4                   |
| 2              | 2                   |
| 3              | 1                   |

**Part 1: Noticing the Pattern**

1. In Scenario A (pizza), if the number of people *doubles* from 2 to 4, what happens to slices per person?

```{mcq}
#| label: sgn-pizza-double
#| inline: true
1. It doubles
2. It is cut in half [correct]
3. It decreases by 2
4. It stays the same
```

2. In Scenario B (lily pads), if you wait *one more winter* (from 1 to 2 winters), what happens to the lily pad count?

```{mcq}
#| label: sgn-lily-one-more
#| inline: true
1. It doubles
2. It is cut in half [correct]
3. It decreases by 2
4. It stays the same
```

3. These two scenarios *look* similar because both involve halving. But the **trigger** for halving is different. In Scenario A, what causes the halving?

```{mcq}
#| label: sgn-trigger-a
1. Doubling the input (number of people) [correct]
2. Adding 1 to the input
3. Waiting one time period
4. Random chance
```

4. In Scenario B, what causes the halving?

```{mcq}
#| label: sgn-trigger-b
1. Doubling the input (number of winters)
2. Adding 1 to the input (one more winter) [correct]
3. Doubling the lily pad count
4. Random chance
```

**Part 2: Identifying the Functions**

5. Scenario A (pizza sharing) is best modeled by which function? (Hint: slices = 8/people)

```{mcq}
#| label: sgn-model-a
#| inline: true
1. recip(x) scaled appropriately [correct]
2. double(-x) scaled appropriately
3. doublings(x)
4. hillside(x)
```

6. Scenario B (lily pad die-off) is best modeled by which function? (Hint: lily pads = 8 × 2^(-winters))

```{mcq}
#| label: sgn-model-b
#| inline: true
1. recip(x) scaled appropriately
2. double(-x) scaled appropriately [correct]
3. doublings(x)
4. hillside(x)
```

```{webr}
#| caption: Explore both functions
# Scenario A: Pizza sharing (recip)
# slices = 8 / people
slice_plot(8 * recip(x) ~ x, domain(x = 1:10), color = "blue") |>
  gf_labs(title = "Pizza: 8/people", x = "Number of people", y = "Slices per person")

# Scenario B: Lily pad die-off (exponential decay)  
# lily_pads = 8 * 2^(-winters)
slice_plot(8 * double(-x) ~ x, domain(x = 0:5), color = "red") |>
  gf_labs(title = "Lily pads: 8 × 2^(-winters)", x = "Winters passed", y = "Lily pads remaining")
```

**Part 3: The Key Distinction**

7. Which statement best captures the difference between these two functions?

```{mcq}
#| label: sgn-key-difference
1. recip decreases and double(-x) increases
2. recip is for small numbers, double(-x) is for large numbers
3. recip: "doubling input halves output" vs double(-x): "each unit of input halves output" [correct hint: This is the key insight! With recip, you must DOUBLE the input to halve the output. With double(-x), adding just ONE unit to the input halves the output.]
4. They are mathematically the same function
```

**Part 4: Apply Your Understanding**

For each scenario, decide: Is this a `recip` situation (doubling input halves output) or a `double(-x)` situation (each time unit halves output)?

8. **Radioactive decay**: A substance has a half-life of 10 years. Every 10 years, half remains.

```{mcq}
#| label: sgn-apply-radioactive
#| inline: true
1. recip (inverse proportionality)
2. double(-x) (exponential decay) [correct]
```

9. **Splitting a bill**: If 3 friends split a $90 bill, each pays $30. If 6 friends split it, each pays $15.

```{mcq}
#| label: sgn-apply-bill
#| inline: true
1. recip (inverse proportionality) [correct]
2. double(-x) (exponential decay)
```

10. **Medicine metabolism**: A drug's concentration drops by half every 4 hours.

```{mcq}
#| label: sgn-apply-medicine
#| inline: true
1. recip (inverse proportionality)
2. double(-x) (exponential decay) [correct]
```

11. **Crowdfunding**: If a $10,000 goal is split among backers, more backers means less money needed per person.

```{mcq}
#| label: sgn-apply-crowdfund
#| inline: true
1. recip (inverse proportionality) [correct]
2. double(-x) (exponential decay)
```

12. **Phone battery**: Your phone loses half its remaining charge every 3 hours of use.

```{mcq}
#| label: sgn-apply-battery
#| inline: true
1. recip (inverse proportionality)
2. double(-x) (exponential decay) [correct]
```
