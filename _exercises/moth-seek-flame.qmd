**Two-input functions and interaction**

In an epidemic model, **new cases per day** may depend on both the number of **susceptible** people \(S\) and the number of **infective** people \(I\). So we want a function of two inputs: \(\text{new\_cases}(S, I)\). A simple choice is to use a linear combination where each ingredient is a function of *one* input: e.g. \(a\,f(S) + b\,g(I)\). Another option is to use **function multiplication** with two inputs: \(f(S)\,g(I)\).

**1.** If we want new cases to be *large* when both \(S\) and \(I\) are large, and *small* when either \(S\) or \(I\) is small, which of these forms is more appropriate?

```{mcq}
#| label: msf-form
1. A linear combination \(a\,\text{steady}(S) + b\,\text{steady}(I)\) (effect of S and I just add)
2. A product like \(\text{steady}(S) \cdot \text{steady}(I)\) [correct hint: Product is large only when both factors are large.]
3. A pipeline \(\text{steady}(S)(\text{steady}(I))\)
4. flat() only
```

**2.** The form \(\text{steady}(S) \cdot \text{steady}(I)\) is often called an **interaction term**. In words, when is this term large?

```{mcq}
#| label: msf-interaction
1. When S is large or I is large
2. When S and I are both large [correct]
3. When S equals I
4. When either S or I is zero
```

**3.** A model of **student performance** might use \(\text{perf}(\text{income}, \text{ed}, \text{skill}) = a\,\text{steady}(\text{income}) + b\,\text{steady}(\text{skill}) + c\,\text{steady}(\text{ed}) + d\cdot\text{flat}()\). Here the modeler implicitly used which storybook functions for each input?

```{mcq}
#| label: msf-perf
1. \(\text{hill}(x)\) for each
2. \(\text{steady}(x)\) for income, skill, and ed; \(\text{flat}()\) for the constant [correct]
3. \(\text{flat}()\) for all
4. \(\text{hillside}(x)\) for all
```

**4.** If we suspect that the effect of **income** on performance diminishes at high income (diminishing returns), we might replace the term that depends on income with a different storybook function. Which would be a reasonable replacement for \(\text{steady}(\text{income})\)?

```{mcq}
#| label: msf-replace
1. \(\text{flat}()\)
2. \(\text{magnitude}(x)\) or \(\text{hillside}(x)\) [correct]
3. \(\text{osc}(x)\)
4. \(\text{recip}(x)\)
```

**5.** The algebraic form of \(\text{steady}(S) \cdot \text{steady}(I)\) is usually written as:

`r devoirs::devoirs_set(choices = c("S + I", "S * I", "S / I", "S - I"), correct = "S * I", id = "msf-algebraic")`

**6.** In one sentence, why might an interaction term be useful when "the effect of x depends on the size of z"?

`r devoirs::devoirs_text("msf-why", rows = 2)`
