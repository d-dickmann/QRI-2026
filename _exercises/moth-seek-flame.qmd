**Two-input functions and interaction**

In an epidemic model, **new cases per day** may depend on both the number of **susceptible** people \(S\) and the number of **infective** people \(I\). So we want a function of two inputs: **new_cases**($S$, $I$). A simple choice is to use a linear combination where each ingredient is a function of *one* input: e.g. $a\,f(S) + b\,g(I)$. Another option is to use **function multiplication** with two inputs: $f(S)\,g(I)$.

**1.** If we want new cases to be *large* when both \(S\) and \(I\) are large, and *small* when either \(S\) or \(I\) is small, which of these forms is more appropriate?

```{mcq}
#| label: msf-form
1. A linear combination $a\cdot$**steady**($S$) $+ b\cdot$**steady**($I$) (effect of S and I just add)
2. A product like **steady**($S$)·**steady**($I$) [correct hint: Product is large only when both factors are large.]
3. A pipeline **steady**($S$)(**steady**($I$))
4. **flat**() only
```

**2.** The form **steady**($S$)·**steady**($I$) is often called an **interaction term**. In words, when is this term large?

```{mcq}
#| label: msf-interaction
1. When S is large or I is large
2. When S and I are both large [correct]
3. When S equals I
4. When either S or I is zero
```

**3.** A model of **student performance** might use **perf**(income, ed, skill) $= a\cdot$**steady**(income) $+ b\cdot$**steady**(skill) $+ c\cdot$**steady**(ed) $+ d\cdot$**flat**(). Here the modeler implicitly used which storybook functions for each input?

```{mcq}
#| label: msf-perf
1. **hill**($x$) for each
2. **steady**($x$) for income, skill, and ed; **flat**() for the constant [correct]
3. **flat**() for all
4. **hillside**($x$) for all
```

**4.** If we suspect that the effect of **income** on performance diminishes at high income (diminishing returns), we might replace the term that depends on income with a different storybook function. Which would be a reasonable replacement for **steady**(income)?

```{mcq}
#| label: msf-replace
1. **flat**()
2. **magnitude**($x$) or **hillside**($x$) [correct]
3. **osc**($x$)
4. **recip**($x$)
```

**5.** The algebraic form of **steady**($S$)·**steady**($I$) is usually written as:

`r devoirs::devoirs_set(choices = c("S + I", "S * I", "S / I", "S - I"), correct = "S * I", id = "msf-algebraic")`

**6.** In one sentence, why might an interaction term be useful when "the effect of x depends on the size of z"?

`r devoirs::devoirs_text("msf-why", rows = 2)`
