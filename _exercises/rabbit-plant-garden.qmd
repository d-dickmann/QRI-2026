This exercise focuses on **input and output transformations**—the technique for adapting storybook functions to model real-world data.

**The setup:** You're modeling the spread of a viral video. The data shows:

- At week 0, essentially no one had seen it (views ≈ 0)
- By week 10, about half of the eventual maximum viewers had seen it
- By week 20, views had essentially plateaued at 2 million

The `hillside()` function naturally outputs ≈ 0 for large negative inputs, 0.5 when input = 0, and ≈ 1 for large positive inputs.

**Part A: Input transformation**

The input transformation has the form $a(q - q_0)$ where $q$ is the real-world input (weeks).

1. What value should $q_0$ have so that `hillside()` outputs 0.5 at week 10?

`r devoirs::devoirs_set(choices = c(0, 0.5, 5, 10, 20), correct = 10, id = "rpg-q0")`

2. We want `hillside()` to output ≈ 1 around week 20. The input to `hillside()` should be around +2 when week = 20. Solve for $a$.

`r devoirs::devoirs_set(choices = c(0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2), correct = 0.2, id = "rpg-a")`

3. What are the units of $a$?

```{mcq}
#| label: rpg-a-units
#| inline: true
1. weeks
2. per week [correct]
3. views
4. dimensionless
```

**Part B: Output transformation**

The output transformation has the form $A \cdot \text{hillside}(\ldots) + B$.

4. What should $A$ be to scale the output to 2 million views?

`r devoirs::devoirs_set(choices = c(1, 1000, 1000000, 2000000), correct = 2000000, id = "rpg-A")`

5. What are the units of $A$?

```{mcq}
#| label: rpg-A-units
#| inline: true
1. weeks
2. per week
3. views [correct]
4. dimensionless
```

**Part C: Build and test the model**

6. Define your transformation parameters and plot the model. Fill in the values for `a`, `q0`, and `A`:

```{webr}
#| caption: Define parameters and plot
# Define the transformation parameters
a <- ___    # input scaling (per week)
q0 <- ___   # input shift (weeks) 
A <- ___    # output scaling (views)

# Plot the model
slice_plot(A * hillside(a * (week - q0)) ~ week, 
           domain(week = 0:25)) |>
  gf_labs(y = "Views", x = "Week")
```

7. According to your model, approximately how many views would there be at week 5?

`r devoirs::devoirs_set(choices = c("about 150,000", "about 500,000", "about 1,000,000", "about 1,500,000"), correct = "about 500,000", id = "rpg-week5")`

8. **Model limitations:** What aspects of real viral video spread does this model fail to capture? Consider factors like the initial launch, word-of-mouth dynamics, platform algorithms, or what happens after the "plateau."

`r devoirs::devoirs_text("rpg-limitations", rows = 3)`
