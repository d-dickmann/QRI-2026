**Polynomials and monomials**

A **polynomial** is a linear combination of a few simple building blocks. Those building blocks are called **monomials**. Using storybook names, the simplest monomials are: **flat**() (constant 1), **steady**($x$) (just $x$), **steady**($x$)·**steady**($x$) (i.e. $x^2$), and so on. So when we write a quadratic like $ax^2 + bx + c$, we are choosing a linear combination of exactly three ingredient functions: the constant (**flat**), the identity (**steady**), and the square (**steady**·**steady**). The "poly" in polynomial means "many" of these monomial terms.

Example: suppose we model **profit** (in dollars) as a function of **price** $x$ (in dollars) with a quadratic. We might write it in storybook form as $2\cdot$**steady**($x$)·**steady**($x$) $-\, 7\cdot$**steady**($x$) $+ \,3\cdot$**flat**() — i.e. $2x^2 - 7x + 3$. Run the code below to see the shape. You can change the coefficients (2, -7, 3) to see how the curve changes.

```{webr}
#| caption: "Quadratic in storybook form — profit vs price (example)"
# Linear combination: 2·steady(x)·steady(x) - 7·steady(x) + 3·flat()
slice_plot(2*steady(x)*steady(x) - 7*steady(x) + 3*flat(x) ~ x, domain(x = 0:4))

**1.** In the quadratic $ax^2 + bx + c$, which storybook function corresponds to the term $x^2$?

```{mcq}
#| label: cow-x2
1. **flat**()
2. **steady**($x$)
3. **steady**($x$)·**steady**($x$) [correct]
4. **hillside**($x$)
```

**2.** In the example $2x^2 - 7x + 3$, what are the three *coefficients* (the numbers we multiply each ingredient by)?

```{mcq}
#| label: cow-coeffs
1. **flat**(), **steady**($x$), **steady**($x$)·**steady**($x$)
2. $x^2$, $x$, and 1
3. 2, $-7$, and 3 [correct]
4. 0, 2, and 4 (the domain)
```

**3.** The "poly" in polynomial means "many." Many of what?

```{mcq}
#| label: cow-poly
1. Many coefficients
2. Many inputs
3. Many monomial terms in the linear combination [correct]
4. Many outputs
```

**4.** What are the three *ingredient functions* (monomials) in the quadratic $5x^2 - 3x + 10$?

```{mcq}
#| label: cow-monomials
1. 5, $-3$, and 10
2. $5x^2$, $-3x$, and 10
3. $x^2$, $x$, and the constant 1 — i.e. **steady**·**steady**, **steady**, and **flat** [correct]
4. Three different storybook functions that are not flat or steady
```

**5.** In modeling, polynomials are often used as flexible "modeling clay" to fit curves. What is a limitation of interpreting a polynomial *mechanistically*?

```{mcq}
#| label: cow-mechanism
1. They cannot have zeros.
2. The polynomial does not tell you *why* the relationship has that shape. [correct]
3. They only work for one input.
4. They are rarely used in practice.
```

**6.** Write the quadratic $2x^2 + 7x - 1$ in storybook form: one term for each monomial, with the right coefficient. Use **flat**(), **steady**($x$), and **steady**($x$)·**steady**($x$). (Example format: $a\cdot$**flat**() $+ b\cdot$**steady**($x$) $+ c\cdot$**steady**($x$)·**steady**($x$).)
