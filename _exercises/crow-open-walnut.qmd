**Polynomials and monomials**

A **polynomial** is a linear combination of simpler functions called **monomials**. Using storybook names: **flat**(), **steady**($x$), **steady**($x$)·**steady**($x$), **steady**($x$)·**steady**($x$)·**steady**($x$), and so on. In algebra we write these as 1, $x$, $x^2$, $x^3$, etc. So the quadratic polynomial $a x^2 + b x + c$ is a linear combination of three ingredient functions.

**1.** In the quadratic $a x^2 + b x + c$, which storybook function corresponds to the term $x^2$?

```{mcq}
#| label: cow-x2
1. **flat**()
2. **steady**($x$)
3. **steady**($x$)·**steady**($x$) (i.e. $x^2$) [correct]
4. **hillside**($x$)
```

**2.** The "poly" in polynomial means "many." Many of what?

```{mcq}
#| label: cow-poly
1. Many coefficients
2. Many inputs
3. Many terms (monomials) in the linear combination [correct]
4. Many outputs
```

**3.** What are the three monomials (ingredient functions) in the quadratic \(5x^2 - 3x + 10\)?

```{mcq}
#| label: cow-monomials
1. 5, -3, 10
2. \(5x^2\), \(-3x\), 10
3. $x^2$, $x$, and the constant 1 (i.e. **flat**()) [correct]
4. **steady**($x$)·**steady**($x$), **steady**($x$), **flat**()
```

**4.** The quadratic formula \(x_0 = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\) is used for what purpose?

```{mcq}
#| label: cow-formula
1. To evaluate a polynomial at a point
2. To find zeros of a quadratic polynomial [correct]
3. To multiply two polynomials
4. To differentiate a polynomial
```

**5.** In modeling, polynomials are sometimes used as "modeling clay" because they are flexible. What is a limitation of interpreting a polynomial model in terms of *mechanism*?

```{mcq}
#| label: cow-mechanism
1. They cannot have zeros.
2. The polynomial itself does not tell you the underlying mechanism. [correct]
3. They only work for one input.
4. They are never used in practice.
```

**6.** Write the quadratic $2x^2 + 7x - 1$ in the form "coefficient × storybook form" for each term (e.g. $a\cdot$**flat**$() + b\cdot$**steady**$(x) + \cdots$). Use the function names **flat**(), **steady**($x$), and **steady**($x$)·**steady**($x$).
