**Multiplication vs. pipelining**

For two single-input functions \(f\) and \(g\), we can combine them in two different ways:

- **Multiplication:** \(h(x) = f(x) \cdot g(x)\) — one input \(x\) is used in both functions; the outputs are multiplied.
- **Pipelining:** \(h(x) = f(g(x))\) — the output of \(g\) is fed as the input to \(f\). (Pipelining is also known as **piping** or **composing functions**.)

In display form:

- **Multiplication:** $h(x) = f(x)\cdot g(x)$  
- **Pipelining:** $h(x) = f(g(x))$

```{webr}
#| caption: Compare multiplication and pipelining
# In R, a line starting with # is a comment: it is not run.
# Add or remove # at the start of a line to choose which plot runs.
# Multiplication: hill(x) * hillside(x)
slice_plot(hill(x) * hillside(x) ~ x, domain(x = -2:4))
# Pipelining: hill(hillside(x)) — uncomment the next line to run it instead
# slice_plot(hill(hillside(x)) ~ x, domain(x = -2:4))
```

**1.** Consider the function $h(x) =$ **steady**$(x)\cdot$ **steady**$(x)$. What is another name for this function?

```{mcq}
#| label: obd-square
1. flat($x$)
2. steady($x$)
3. The square of $x$, i.e. $x^2$ [correct]
4. A pipeline of steady($x$) and steady($x$)
```

**2.** True or false: \(f(x)\,g(x)\) and \(f(g(x))\) are always the same.

```{mcq}
#| label: obd-same
1. True
2. False [correct]
```

**3.** Can pipelining two single-input functions ever produce a function with *two* inputs?

```{mcq}
#| label: obd-two-inputs
1. Yes
2. No [correct hint: There is only one argument slot—the input to the interior function.]
```

**4.** Suppose $h(x) =$ **hill**$($ **steady**$(x) + 2)$. Which function is in the *interior* position?

```{mcq}
#| label: obd-interior
1. hill($x$)
2. steady($x$) [correct]
3. Both are interior
4. Neither; this is multiplication
```

**5.** In the expression \(j(x, z) = f(x)\,g(z)\), how many inputs does \(j\) have, and is this multiplication or pipelining?

```{mcq}
#| label: obd-jxz
1. One input; pipelining
2. One input; multiplication
3. Two inputs; pipelining
4. Two inputs; multiplication [correct]
```

**6.** Give a one-sentence reason why \(f(x)\cdot g(x)\) and \(f(g(x))\) are different in general.
