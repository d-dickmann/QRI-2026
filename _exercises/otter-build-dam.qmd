**Multiplication vs. pipelining**

For two single-input functions \(f\) and \(g\), we can combine them in two different ways:

- **Multiplication:** \(h(x) = f(x) \cdot g(x)\) (one input \(x\)).
- **Pipelining:** \(h(x) = f(g(x))\) — the output of \(g\) is fed as the input to \(f\).

```{webr}
#| caption: Compare multiplication and pipelining
# Multiplication: hill(x) * hillside(x)
slice_plot(hill(x) * hillside(x) ~ x, domain(x = -2:4))
# Pipelining: hill(hillside(x))
# slice_plot(hill(hillside(x)) ~ x, domain(x = -2:4))
```

**1.** Consider \(h(x) = \text{steady}(x) \cdot \text{steady}(x)\). What is another name for this function?

```{mcq}
#| label: obd-square
1. flat()
2. steady()
3. The square of x, i.e. \(x^2\) [correct]
4. A pipeline of steady and steady
```

**2.** True or false: \(f(x)\,g(x)\) and \(f(g(x))\) are always the same.

```{mcq}
#| label: obd-same
1. True
2. False [correct]
```

**3.** Can pipelining two single-input functions ever produce a function with *two* inputs?

```{mcq}
#| label: obd-two-inputs
1. Yes
2. No [correct hint: There is only one argument slot—the input to the interior function.]
```

**4.** Suppose \(h(x) = \text{hill}(\text{steady}(x) + 2)\). Which function is in the *interior* position?

```{mcq}
#| label: obd-interior
1. hill()
2. steady() [correct]
3. Both are interior
4. Neither; this is multiplication
```

**5.** In the expression \(j(x, z) = f(x)\,g(z)\), how many inputs does \(j\) have, and is this multiplication or pipelining?

```{mcq}
#| label: obd-jxz
1. One input; pipelining
2. One input; multiplication
3. Two inputs; pipelining
4. Two inputs; multiplication [correct]
```

**6.** Give a one-sentence reason why \(f(x)\,g(x)\) and \(f(g(x))\) are different in general.
