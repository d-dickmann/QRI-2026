The storybook functions `double()` and `doublings()` are related. Use the R chunk to explore them.

```{webr}
#| caption: Explore double() and doublings()
# Here's a plot of double() to get you started.
slice_plot(double(x) ~ x, domain(x = -2:5))

# You can also look at the output of a function for a given value
doublings(128)
```

1. What is `double(5)`?

`r devoirs::devoirs_set(choices = c(5, 10, 16, 25, 32), correct = 32, id = "frb-double-5")`

2. What is `double(-3)`?

`r devoirs::devoirs_set(choices = c(-8, -3, 0.125, 0.25, 3), correct = 0.125, id = "frb-double-neg")`

3. What is `doublings(64)`?

`r devoirs::devoirs_set(choices = c(4, 5, 6, 7, 8), correct = 6, id = "frb-doublings-64")`

4. What is `doublings(0.25)`?

`r devoirs::devoirs_set(choices = c(-4, -2, -1, 0.25, 2), correct = -2, id = "frb-doublings-quarter")`

5. If `double(x)` outputs 256, what is `x`?

`r devoirs::devoirs_set(choices = c(4, 6, 8, 16, 128), correct = 8, id = "frb-find-input")`

6. If `doublings(x)` outputs 5, what is `x`?

`r devoirs::devoirs_set(choices = c(5, 10, 16, 25, 32), correct = 32, id = "frb-find-input-2")`

7. What is `doublings(double(4))`?

`r devoirs::devoirs_set(choices = c(2, 4, 8, 16, 256), correct = 4, id = "frb-compose-1")`

8. What is `double(doublings(64))`?

`r devoirs::devoirs_set(choices = c(6, 12, 32, 64, 4096), correct = 64, id = "frb-compose-2")`

9. Based on questions 7 and 8, what is the relationship between `double()` and `doublings()`?

```{mcq}
#| label: frb-inverse
1. They always give the same output
2. They are inverses—each undoes the other [correct]
3. One is always twice the other
4. They have no particular relationship
```
