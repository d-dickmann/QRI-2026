The storybook functions `double()` and `doublings()` are closely related but serve different purposes.

- `double(x)` tells you the result after $x$ doublings (output = $2^x$)
- `doublings(y)` tells you how many doublings are needed to reach output $y$

Use the interactive R chunk to explore these functions.

```{webr}
#| caption: Explore double() and doublings()
# Try different inputs
double(3)      # After 3 doublings, what do you have?
doublings(8)   # How many doublings to reach 8?
```

**Questions about double():**

1. Starting with 1 item, after 5 doublings, how many items do you have?

`r devoirs::devoirs_set(choices = c(5, 10, 16, 25, 32), correct = 32, id = "frb-double-5")`

2. If bacteria double every hour, and you start with 1 bacterium, how many will you have after 10 hours?

`r devoirs::devoirs_set(choices = c(10, 20, 100, 512, 1024), correct = 1024, id = "frb-bacteria")`

3. What is `double(-2)`? (Think: what happens with negative doublings?)

`r devoirs::devoirs_set(choices = c(-4, -2, 0.25, 0.5, 2), correct = 0.25, id = "frb-double-neg")`

```{webr}
#| caption: Try your own calculations
# Test double() and doublings() with different inputs
double(5)
double(-2)
doublings(64)
doublings(0.5)
```

**Questions about doublings():**

4. If a population grew from 1 to 64, how many doublings occurred?

`r devoirs::devoirs_set(choices = c(4, 5, 6, 7, 8), correct = 6, id = "frb-doublings-64")`

5. A savings account doubled from $1000 to $2000. How many "doublings" is this?

`r devoirs::devoirs_set(choices = c(0.5, 1, 2, 1000), correct = 1, id = "frb-doublings-2000")`

6. What is `doublings(0.5)`?

`r devoirs::devoirs_set(choices = c(-2, -1, 0, 0.5, 1), correct = -1, id = "frb-doublings-half")`

**The relationship between double() and doublings():**

The functions `double()` and `doublings()` are related: if you know the output of `double()`, you can use `doublings()` to find what input produced it, and vice versa.

```{webr}
#| caption: Explore the relationship
# What happens when you combine them?
double(5)
doublings(32)
```

7. If `double(x)` gives output 32, what was the input `x`?

`r devoirs::devoirs_set(choices = c(2, 4, 5, 6, 16), correct = 5, id = "frb-find-input")`

8. If `doublings(y)` gives output 4, what was the input `y`?

`r devoirs::devoirs_set(choices = c(2, 4, 8, 16, 32), correct = 16, id = "frb-find-input-2")`

9. Based on questions 7 and 8, what is the relationship between `double()` and `doublings()`?

```{mcq}
#| label: frb-inverse
1. They always give the same output
2. They "undo" each other—doublings() finds the input that would give a particular output from double() [correct]
3. One is always twice the other
4. They have no particular relationship
```
