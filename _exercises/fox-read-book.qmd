The storybook functions `double()` and `doublings()` are closely related but serve different purposes. Use the R chunk to explore them.

```{webr}
#| caption: Explore double() and doublings()
# Try different inputs to both functions

```

1. Starting with 1 item, after 5 doublings, how many items do you have?

`r devoirs::devoirs_set(choices = c(5, 10, 16, 25, 32), correct = 32, id = "frb-double-5")`

2. If bacteria double every hour, and you start with 1 bacterium, how many will you have after 10 hours?

`r devoirs::devoirs_set(choices = c(10, 20, 100, 512, 1024), correct = 1024, id = "frb-bacteria")`

3. What is `double(-2)`?

`r devoirs::devoirs_set(choices = c(-4, -2, 0.25, 0.5, 2), correct = 0.25, id = "frb-double-neg")`

4. If a population grew from 1 to 64, how many doublings occurred?

`r devoirs::devoirs_set(choices = c(4, 5, 6, 7, 8), correct = 6, id = "frb-doublings-64")`

5. What is `doublings(0.5)`?

`r devoirs::devoirs_set(choices = c(-2, -1, 0, 0.5, 1), correct = -1, id = "frb-doublings-half")`

6. If `double(x)` gives output 128, what was the input `x`?

`r devoirs::devoirs_set(choices = c(4, 5, 6, 7, 64), correct = 7, id = "frb-find-input")`

7. If `doublings(y)` gives output 4, what was the input `y`?

`r devoirs::devoirs_set(choices = c(2, 4, 8, 16, 32), correct = 16, id = "frb-find-input-2")`

8. What is the relationship between `double()` and `doublings()`?

```{mcq}
#| label: frb-inverse
1. They always give the same output
2. They "undo" each other [correct]
3. One is always twice the other
4. They have no particular relationship
```
