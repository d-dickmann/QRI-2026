**Build a model from scratch.**

A hot cup of coffee is left on a counter in a room that stays at 70°F. The coffee starts at 180°F. After 10 minutes, it has cooled to 125°F. After 20 minutes, it's at 97.5°F. After 30 minutes, it's at 83.75°F.

| Time (min) | Temperature (°F) |
|------------|------------------|
| 0          | 180              |
| 10         | 125              |
| 20         | 97.5             |
| 30         | 83.75            |

Your task: Build a model for the coffee's temperature as a function of time using a storybook function and appropriate input/output transformations.

```

**Hints to consider (but you must figure out the details):**

- What quantity is actually decaying? (It's not the temperature itself.)
- What storybook function describes something that halves repeatedly?
- What transformations are needed to make the model match the data?

When you have a model, test it by checking that it produces the correct temperatures at t = 0, 10, 20, and 30.

**Your final model:**

Write a formula for Temperature as a function of time t (in minutes):

`r devoirs::devoirs_text("dcr-model", rows = 1)`

**Explain your reasoning:**

Why did you choose this storybook function? How did you determine the transformations?

`r devoirs::devoirs_text("dcr-reasoning", rows = 4)`
