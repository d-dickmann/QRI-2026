**Chemical Spill Response**

A tanker truck accident has spilled industrial solvent into a municipal reservoir. The EPA safe limit for this chemical is **5 parts per million (ppm)**. Initial readings show a concentration of **80 ppm**.

Environmental engineers take measurements over the following days:

| Days after spill | Concentration (ppm) |
|------------------|---------------------|
| 0                | 80                  |
| 3                | 40                  |
| 6                | 20                  |
| 9                | 10                  |

The city needs to know: **When will the water be safe to drink?**

```{webr}
#| caption: Build and test your model

```

Your task: Build a model for **contamination level** (in ppm) as a function of **days since the spill**, then use it to answer the city's question.

**Your model:**

Write a formula for concentration C as a function of days d:

`r devoirs::devoirs_text("dcr-model", rows = 1)`

**The decision:**

According to your model, on what day will the concentration first drop below the 5 ppm safety threshold? Show your reasoning.

`r devoirs::devoirs_text("dcr-decision", rows = 3)`

**Reflection:**

The mayor wants to announce a reopening date. What would you advise, and why might you recommend some buffer time beyond what the model predicts?

`r devoirs::devoirs_text("dcr-reflection", rows = 3)`
