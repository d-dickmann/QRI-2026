The functions `recip()`, `double()`, and `doublings()` each have distinctive shapes that make them suitable for different modeling situations.

- **recip(x)** = 1/x : Falls rapidly at first, then levels off approaching zero
- **double(x)** = 2^x : Grows slowly at first, then increasingly rapidly  
- **doublings(x)** = log₂(x) : Grows rapidly at first, then increasingly slowly

```{webr}
#| caption: Compare the three functions
slice_plot(recip(x) ~ x, domain(x = 0.5:5), color = "red") |>
  gf_labs(title = "recip(x) in red")

slice_plot(double(x) ~ x, domain(x = -2:4), color = "blue") |>
  gf_labs(title = "double(x) in blue")

slice_plot(doublings(x) ~ x, domain(x = 0.1:10), color = "green") |>
  gf_labs(title = "doublings(x) in green")
```

For each scenario below, decide which function would best model the relationship.

1. **Input**: Number of workers on a task. **Output**: Time to complete the task. (More workers = faster completion, but you can't make it instant.)

```{mcq}
#| label: dcr-1-workers
#| inline: true
1. recip() [correct]
2. double()
3. doublings()
```

2. **Input**: Time since you started saving money in a high-interest compound account. **Output**: Balance in the account.

```{mcq}
#| label: dcr-2-savings
#| inline: true
1. recip()
2. double() [correct]
3. doublings()
```

3. **Input**: Amount of RAM in a computer. **Output**: Perceived improvement in performance (each doubling of RAM feels like a similar improvement).

```{mcq}
#| label: dcr-3-ram
#| inline: true
1. recip()
2. double()
3. doublings() [correct]
```

4. **Input**: Number of days since an epidemic began. **Output**: Number of infected people (in the early exponential growth phase).

```{mcq}
#| label: dcr-4-epidemic
#| inline: true
1. recip()
2. double() [correct]
3. doublings()
```

5. **Input**: Loudness of a sound (in physical power units). **Output**: How loud it sounds to a human (perceived loudness).

```{mcq}
#| label: dcr-5-loudness
#| inline: true
1. recip()
2. double()
3. doublings() [correct hint: Human perception of loudness follows a logarithmic scale—doubling the power produces a constant increase in perceived loudness.]
```

6. **Input**: Distance from a light source. **Output**: Brightness of the light at that distance.

```{mcq}
#| label: dcr-6-light
#| inline: true
1. recip() [correct hint: Light intensity follows an inverse-square law—as distance increases, brightness decreases rapidly then levels off.]
2. double()
3. doublings()
```

7. **Input**: Number of practice hours. **Output**: Skill improvement (the 10,000-hour rule suggests diminishing returns).

```{mcq}
#| label: dcr-7-practice
#| inline: true
1. recip()
2. double()
3. doublings() [correct hint: Early practice hours yield large improvements; later hours yield smaller (but still positive) improvements.]
```
