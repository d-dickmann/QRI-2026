**Combining storybook functions to make new shapes**

We can build more complex shapes by **combining** two storybook functions in different ways: **multiplication**, **linear combination** (adding scaled versions), or **composition** (one function’s output as the other’s input). This exercise uses **hill**($x$) (a symmetric bump) and **hillside**($x$) (an S-curve that rises and levels off) as building blocks. All plots use the domain $x \in [-2, 4]$ so both shapes are visible.

---

**Step 1: The two building blocks**

Run the code below to see **hill**($x$) and **hillside**($x$) on their own. Add or remove `#` at the start of a line to choose which plot runs.

```{webr}
#| caption: "Building blocks — hill(x) and hillside(x)"
# In R, # starts a comment; the line is not run.
slice_plot(hill(x) ~ x, domain(x = -2:4))
# slice_plot(hillside(x) ~ x, domain(x = -2:4))
```

---

**Step 2: Three ways to combine them**

**A. Multiplication:** $h(x) =$ **hill**($x$) $\cdot$ **hillside**($x$). The output is large only where *both* are moderately large, so you get a single asymmetric bump that falls off on the left and right.

**B. Linear combination:** $h(x) = 0.6\cdot$ **hill**($x$) $+ 0.4\cdot$ **hillside**($x$). The shape is a *blend* of the two: a peak with a rising tail.

**C. Composition (two storybook functions):** $h(x) =$ **hillside**(**hill**($x$)). Think of $x$ as *distance* from a signal source. **Hill**($x$) is the *signal strength* (a bump: strongest nearby, weaker farther away). **Hillside**(signal strength) is the *probability of detecting* the signal (an S-curve: low when the signal is weak, high when it’s strong). So we **compose**: distance $\to$ **hill** $\to$ signal strength $\to$ **hillside** $\to$ detection probability. The output of **hill** becomes the input to **hillside**.

Run each chunk below to see the corresponding plot. Then use the **Explore** chunk to try your own combinations.

```{webr}
#| caption: "A. Multiplication — hill(x) × hillside(x)"
slice_plot(hill(x) * hillside(x) ~ x, domain(x = -2:4))
```

```{webr}
#| caption: "B. Linear combination — 0.6·hill(x) + 0.4·hillside(x)"
slice_plot(0.6*hill(x) + 0.4*hillside(x) ~ x, domain(x = -2:4))
```

```{webr}
#| caption: "C. Composition — hillside(hill(x)); detection probability vs distance"
slice_plot(hillside(hill(x)) ~ x, domain(x = -2:4))
```

---

**Step 3: Explore**

Edit the formula in the code below to experiment. Try: **hill**($x$)$\cdot$**osc**($x$), **hill**($x$) $+$ **hillside**($x$), **hillside**(**hill**($x$)), or **hill**($x - 1$) (input shift). Change the domain if you like (e.g. `domain(x = 0:3)`).

```{webr}
#| caption: "Try your own combination"
# Replace the formula below with another combination of storybook functions.
# Examples: hill(x) * osc(x),  hill(x) + 0.3*hillside(x),  hillside(hill(x)),  hill(x - 1)
slice_plot(hill(x) * hillside(x) ~ x, domain(x = -2:4))
```

**1.** In plot **A** (multiplication **hill**($x$)$\cdot$**hillside**($x$)), how would you describe the shape compared to **hill**($x$) alone?

```{mcq}
#| label: fbs-mult
1. The peak is shifted left.
2. The peak is shifted right.
3. The shape is a single asymmetric bump that is small where either function is small. [correct]
4. The shape has two separate peaks.
```

**2.** In plot **B** (linear combination $0.6\cdot$**hill**($x$) $+ 0.4\cdot$**hillside**($x$)), how would you describe the shape?

```{mcq}
#| label: fbs-lc
1. A symmetric bell with no tail.
2. A blend of a peak and an S-curve: one main peak with a rising tail. [correct]
3. Two separate peaks.
4. The same as **hillside**($x$) only.
```

**3.** In plot **C** (**hillside**(**hill**($x$))), which function is on the *outside* (the one whose output we ultimately see)?

```{mcq}
#| label: fbs-comp
1. **hill** (signal strength)
2. **hillside** (detection probability) [correct]
3. Both are on the outside
4. Neither; C is multiplication
```

**4.** In the composition **hillside**(**hill**($x$)), what is the *inner* function’s output (the input to the outer function)?

```{mcq}
#| label: fbs-which
1. Distance $x$
2. Signal strength (**hill**($x$)) [correct]
3. Detection probability
4. A linear combination of hill and hillside
```

**5.** Suppose you plot **hill**($x$) $\cdot$ **osc**($x$). What do you expect the shape to look like? (**osc** oscillates between $-1$ and $1$.)

```{mcq}
#| label: fbs-osc
1. A single smooth bump like hill(x).
2. A bump whose height oscillates (wavy envelope) as $x$ increases. [correct]
3. A straight line.
4. Two separate bumps.
