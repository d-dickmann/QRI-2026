Consider these four storybook functions and their characteristic shapes:

- **flat()**: Output doesn't change regardless of input
- **steady()**: Output increases at a constant rate as input increases  
- **hillside()**: Output starts low, gradually increases, then levels off at a higher value
- **hill()**: Output rises from a baseline to a peak, then falls back to the baseline

For each real-world scenario below, choose which storybook function would best model the relationship between the input and output.

1. **Input**: Amount of fertilizer applied to a garden plot. **Output**: Crop yield from that plot. (Hint: Too little fertilizer means low yield, but too much can actually harm plants.)

```{mcq}
#| label: bcm-1-fertilizer
#| inline: true
1. flat()
2. steady()
3. hillside()
4. hill() [correct]
```

2. **Input**: Years of experience in a profession. **Output**: Annual salary. (Assume salaries tend to plateau at senior levels.)

```{mcq}
#| label: bcm-2-salary
#| inline: true
1. flat()
2. steady()
3. hillside() [correct]
4. hill()
```

3. **Input**: Distance from your house. **Output**: Your familiarity with the neighborhood streets.

```{mcq}
#| label: bcm-3-familiarity
#| inline: true
1. flat()
2. steady()
3. hillside()
4. hill() [correct hint: You're most familiar with streets near your house, less familiar as you go farther away, and eventually unfamiliar again in distant areas.]
```

4. **Input**: Number of hours you study for an exam. **Output**: Your exam score. (Assume there's a maximum possible score and diminishing returns from additional studying.)

```{mcq}
#| label: bcm-4-study
#| inline: true
1. flat()
2. steady()
3. hillside() [correct]
4. hill()
```

5. **Input**: The day of the year (1-365). **Output**: Average daily temperature in a northern climate.

```{mcq}
#| label: bcm-5-temp
#| inline: true
1. flat()
2. steady()
3. hillside()
4. None of the above—this requires osc() [correct]
```

6. **Input**: Amount of money invested in advertising. **Output**: Number of new customers gained. (Assume the market can become saturated.)

```{mcq}
#| label: bcm-6-advertising
#| inline: true
1. flat()
2. steady()
3. hillside() [correct]
4. hill()
```
