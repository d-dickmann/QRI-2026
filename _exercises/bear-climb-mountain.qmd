Consider these four storybook functions and their characteristic shapes:

| Function | Shape |
|----------|-------|
| `flat()` | Output doesn't change regardless of input |
| `steady()` | Output increases at a constant rate as input increases |
| `hillside()` | Output starts low, gradually increases, then levels off |
| `hill()` | Output rises to a peak, then falls back down |

For each scenario below, choose which storybook function would best model the relationship.

**1.** Cups of coffee consumed → Work productivity that day. (No coffee leaves you groggy; 1-2 cups makes you alert; 5+ cups leaves you jittery.)

```{mcq}
#| label: bcm-1-coffee
#| inline: true
1. flat()
2. steady()
3. hillside()
4. hill() [correct]
```

**2.** Runtime of a movie (minutes) → Ticket price. (A 90-minute film costs the same as a 3-hour epic.)

```{mcq}
#| label: bcm-2-movie
#| inline: true
1. flat() [correct]
2. steady()
3. hillside()
4. hill()
```

**3.** Depth below ocean surface (meters) → Water pressure on a diver.

```{mcq}
#| label: bcm-3-pressure
#| inline: true
1. flat()
2. steady() [correct hint: Pressure increases by about 1 atmosphere for every 10 meters of depth—a constant rate.]
3. hillside()
4. hill()
```

**4.** Total hours spent learning a new language → Vocabulary words you can recall. (Beginners learn quickly; advanced learners find each new word harder.)

```{mcq}
#| label: bcm-4-language
#| inline: true
1. flat()
2. steady()
3. hillside() [correct]
4. hill()
```

**5.** Days since a meme first appeared → Times it's shared per day. (Memes explode in popularity, peak, then fade.)

```{mcq}
#| label: bcm-5-meme
#| inline: true
1. flat()
2. steady()
3. hillside()
4. hill() [correct]
```

**6.** Hour of the day (0-24) at a coastal beach → Height of the tide.

```{mcq}
#| label: bcm-6-tide
#| inline: true
1. flat()
2. steady()
3. hillside()
4. None of the above—this requires osc() [correct hint: Tides rise and fall in a repeating cycle, roughly twice per day.]
```

**Reflection:**

**7.** Choose ONE of the scenarios above and make a case for using a *different* storybook function to model it. Is the alternative better, equivalent, or worse than your original answer? Why?
