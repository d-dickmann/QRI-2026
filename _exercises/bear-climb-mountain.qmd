For each scenario below, choose which storybook function would best model the relationship.

```{webr}
#| caption: Explore storybook functions
# Plot any storybook function to see its shape:
slice_plot(flat(x) ~ x, domain(x = -3:3))
```

**1.** Model **work productivity** as a function of **cups of coffee consumed**. (No coffee leaves you groggy; 1-2 cups makes you alert; 5+ cups leaves you jittery.)

```{mcq}
#| label: bcm-1-coffee
1. flat()
2. steady()
3. hillside()
4. hill() [correct]
5. osc()
6. double()
7. recip()
```

**2.** Model **ticket price** as a function of **movie runtime** (minutes). (A 90-minute film costs the same as a 3-hour epic.)

```{mcq}
#| label: bcm-2-movie
1. flat() [correct]
2. steady()
3. hillside()
4. hill()
5. osc()
6. double()
7. recip()
```

**3.** Model **tide height** as a function of **hour of the day** (0-24) at a coastal beach.

```{mcq}
#| label: bcm-3-tide
1. flat()
2. steady()
3. hillside()
4. hill()
5. osc() [correct hint: Tides rise and fall in a repeating cycle, roughly twice per day.]
6. double()
7. recip()
```

**4.** Model **vocabulary words you can recall** as a function of **total hours spent learning a new language**. (Beginners learn quickly; advanced learners find each new word harder.)

```{mcq}
#| label: bcm-4-language
1. flat()
2. steady()
3. hillside() [correct]
4. hill()
5. osc()
6. double()
7. recip()
```

**5.** Model **water pressure on a diver** as a function of **depth below ocean surface** (meters).

```{mcq}
#| label: bcm-5-pressure
1. flat()
2. steady() [correct hint: Pressure increases by about 1 atmosphere for every 10 meters of depth—a constant rate.]
3. hillside()
4. hill()
5. osc()
6. double()
7. recip()
```

**6.** Model **times a meme is shared per day** as a function of **days since it first appeared**. (Memes explode in popularity, peak, then fade.)

```{mcq}
#| label: bcm-6-meme
1. flat()
2. steady()
3. hillside()
4. hill() [correct]
5. osc()
6. double()
7. recip()
```

**Reflection:**

**7.** Choose ONE of the scenarios above and make a case for using a *different* storybook function to model it. Is the alternative better, equivalent, or worse than your original answer? Why?

`r devoirs::devoirs_text("bcm-reflection")`
