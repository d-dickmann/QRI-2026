Consider these four storybook functions and their characteristic shapes:

- **flat()**: Output doesn't change regardless of input
- **steady()**: Output increases at a constant rate as input increases  
- **hillside()**: Output starts low, gradually increases, then levels off at a higher value
- **hill()**: Output rises from a baseline to a peak, then falls back to the baseline

For each real-world scenario below, choose which storybook function would best model the relationship between the input and output.

1. **Input**: Cups of coffee consumed in a morning. **Output**: Your work productivity that day. (No coffee leaves you groggy; 1-2 cups makes you alert and focused; 5+ cups leaves you jittery and unable to concentrate.)

```{mcq}
#| label: bcm-1-coffee
#| inline: true
1. flat()
2. steady()
3. hillside()
4. hill() [correct]
```

2. **Input**: Runtime of a movie (in minutes). **Output**: Ticket price at the cinema. (A 90-minute film costs the same as a 3-hour epic.)

```{mcq}
#| label: bcm-2-movie
#| inline: true
1. flat() [correct]
2. steady()
3. hillside()
4. hill()
```

3. **Input**: Depth below the ocean surface (in meters). **Output**: Water pressure experienced by a diver.

```{mcq}
#| label: bcm-3-pressure
#| inline: true
1. flat()
2. steady() [correct hint: Pressure increases by about 1 atmosphere for every 10 meters of depth—a constant rate.]
3. hillside()
4. hill()
```

4. **Input**: Total hours spent learning a new language. **Output**: Number of vocabulary words you can recall. (Beginners pick up words quickly; advanced learners find each new word harder to acquire.)

```{mcq}
#| label: bcm-4-language
#| inline: true
1. flat()
2. steady()
3. hillside() [correct]
4. hill()
```

5. **Input**: Days since a meme first appeared online. **Output**: Number of times it's shared per day. (Memes explode in popularity, peak, then fade into obscurity.)

```{mcq}
#| label: bcm-5-meme
#| inline: true
1. flat()
2. steady()
3. hillside()
4. hill() [correct]
```

6. **Input**: Hour of the day (0-24) at a coastal beach. **Output**: Height of the tide.

```{mcq}
#| label: bcm-6-tide
#| inline: true
1. flat()
2. steady()
3. hillside()
4. None of the above—this requires osc() [correct hint: Tides rise and fall in a repeating cycle, roughly twice per day.]
```

**Reflection question:**

7. Choose ONE of the scenarios above and make a case for using a *different* storybook function to model it. Explain your reasoning: Is the alternative model better than your original answer, roughly equivalent, or worse? Why?
