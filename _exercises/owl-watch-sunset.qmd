The `osc()` function models periodic (repeating) phenomena. It oscillates smoothly between -1 and +1 with a period of 1. Use the R chunk to explore it.

**Modeling a real periodic phenomenon:**

A ferris wheel at a carnival has a radius of 15 meters. The center of the wheel is 18 meters above the ground. The wheel completes one full rotation every 2 minutes. A rider boards at the lowest point of the wheel (3 meters above the ground).

Your task is to model the rider's **height above the ground** (in meters) as a function of **time** (in minutes) since boarding.

1. What is the rider's height at the lowest point of the rotation?

`r devoirs::devoirs_set(choices = c(0, 3, 15, 18, 33), correct = 3, id = "ows-low")`

2. What is the rider's height at the highest point of the rotation?

`r devoirs::devoirs_set(choices = c(15, 18, 30, 33, 36), correct = 33, id = "ows-high")`

3. The basic `osc()` function has a period of 1 (one full cycle per unit input). To make the model have a period of 2 minutes, what input transformation is needed?

`r devoirs::devoirs_set(choices = c("osc(t/2)", "osc(2*t)", "osc(t - 2)", "osc(t + 2)"), correct = "osc(t/2)", id = "ows-period")`

4. The basic `osc()` function oscillates between -1 and +1 (amplitude = 1, centered at 0). Your ferris wheel model needs amplitude = 15 and should be centered at height = 18. Which output transformation achieves this?

`r devoirs::devoirs_set(choices = c("15 * osc(...)", "18 + osc(...)", "18 + 15 * osc(...)", "15 + 18 * osc(...)"), correct = "18 + 15 * osc(...)", id = "ows-output")`

5. There's one more problem: `osc()` starts at 0 (its middle value), but your rider starts at the *bottom* of the wheel. You need to shift the input so the function starts at its minimum. What input shift is needed?

`r devoirs::devoirs_set(choices = c("t + 0.25", "t - 0.25", "t + 0.5", "t - 0.5"), correct = "t - 0.25", id = "ows-shift")`

6. Putting it all together, write the complete model for height (in meters) as a function of time t (in minutes). Enter your answer as a formula.

`r devoirs::devoirs_text("ows-final-model", rows = 1)`
