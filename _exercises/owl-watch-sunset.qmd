**Time-of-Use Electricity Pricing**

Your electric utility charges different rates depending on the time of day. You want to model the price so you can decide when to charge your electric vehicle, run the dishwasher, or do laundry.

The utility publishes sample rates at several times of day:

| Time of day | Price ($/kWh) |
|-------------|---------------|
| 4 AM        | $0.08 (lowest) |
| 10 AM       | $0.20         |
| 4 PM        | $0.32 (highest) |
| 10 PM       | $0.20         |

Assume the price changes continuously and smoothly throughout the day (not in discrete steps).

```{webr}
#| caption: Use this space to explore, build your model, and do any necessary calculations. (Try doing arithmetic here too, for example `(5*2)/2`)
# Here's osc() plotted over its natural domain:
slice_plot(osc(x) ~ x, domain(x = 0:1))
```

Your task: Build a model for **electricity price** (in $/kWh) as a function of **hour of the day** (0-24).

**Output transformation:** The output transformation scales and shifts the vertical axis.

1. What is the vertical shift $Q_0$ (the average price, halfway between highest and lowest)?

`r devoirs::devoirs_set(choices = c(0.08, 0.12, 0.20, 0.24, 0.32), correct = 0.20, id = "ows-avg")`

2. What is the amplitude $A$ (how far the price swings above or below the average)?

`r devoirs::devoirs_set(choices = c(0.08, 0.12, 0.20, 0.24, 0.32), correct = 0.12, id = "ows-amp")`

**Input transformation:** The input transformation scales and shifts the horizontal axis.

3. The basic `osc()` has a period of 1. To make the model have a period of 24 hours, what goes inside osc()?

`r devoirs::devoirs_set(choices = c("hour/24", "hour*24", "hour - 24", "24/hour"), correct = "hour/24", id = "ows-period")`

4. The price peaks at 4 PM (hour 16), but `osc()` peaks when its input equals 0.25. What horizontal shift $q_0$ aligns the peak correctly?

`r devoirs::devoirs_set(choices = c("(hour - 10)/24", "(hour + 10)/24", "(hour - 4)/24", "(hour + 4)/24"), correct = "(hour - 10)/24", id = "ows-shift")`

**The complete model:**

5. Write the complete model for price as a function of hour (0-24):

`r devoirs::devoirs_text("ows-model", rows = 1)`

6. **Decision time:** Your EV needs 4 hours to charge and uses about 10 kWh. According to your model, approximately how much would it cost to charge starting at midnight vs. starting at 5 PM?

`r devoirs::devoirs_text("ows-decision", rows = 2)`

7. **Model validity:** In reality, most power companies use step changes (e.g., "off-peak" from 9 PM to 7 AM at $0.10, "peak" from 4 PM to 9 PM at $0.30) rather than continuously varying rates. Does this information significantly change the validity of your model for making decisions about when to run appliances? Explain.

`r devoirs::devoirs_text("ows-validity", rows = 3)`
