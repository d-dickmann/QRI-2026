**Linear combinations**

A café models its **daily revenue** \(R\) (in dollars) as a function of **hours open** \(t\) (0–12). They use a linear combination of two storybook functions: one term captures a base level of sales, and another captures sales that grow with how long the café is open.

Suppose the model is \(R(t) = 50\,\text{flat}() + 120\,\text{steady}(t)\).

```{webr}
#| caption: Explore the model
slice_plot(50*flat(x) + 120*steady(x) ~ x, domain(x = 0:12))
```

**1.** In this linear combination, what are the two "ingredient" functions?

```{mcq}
#| label: fcw-ingredients
1. 50 and 120
2. flat() and steady() [correct]
3. R and t
4. dollars and hours
```

**2.** What are the coefficients in this combination?

```{mcq}
#| label: fcw-coeffs
1. flat() and steady()
2. 50 and 120 [correct]
3. 0 and 12
4. R and t
```

**3.** When the café is open 0 hours, what does the model predict for revenue?

`r devoirs::devoirs_set(choices = c(0, 50, 120, 170), correct = 50, id = "fcw-R0")`

**4.** When the café is open 5 hours, what does the model predict for revenue (in dollars)?

`r devoirs::devoirs_set(choices = c(110, 550, 600, 650), correct = 650, id = "fcw-R5")`

**5.** The owner considers a different model: \(R(t) = a\,\text{hillside}(t) + b\,\text{flat}()\). What is the main conceptual difference from the first model?

```{mcq}
#| label: fcw-hillside
1. The coefficients are different.
2. Sales now grow in a "diminishing returns" way (steep at first, then leveling off) instead of at a constant rate. [correct]
3. Revenue can be negative.
4. There is no difference.
```

**6.** In a linear combination, who or what typically chooses the *coefficients* after the modeler has chosen the ingredient functions?

`r devoirs::devoirs_text("fcw-who-coeffs", rows = 2)`
