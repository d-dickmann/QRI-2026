**Linear combinations**

A café models its **daily revenue** \(R\) (in dollars) as a function of **hours open** \(t\) (0–12). They use a linear combination of two storybook functions: one term captures a base level of sales, and another captures sales that grow with how long the café is open.

Suppose the model is

$R(t) = 50\cdot$ **flat**$() + 120\cdot$ **steady**$(t)$.

So revenue equals 50 (dollars base) plus 120 times the number of hours open: **flat**() is the constant function (value 1) and **steady**($t$) = $t$.

```{webr}
#| caption: Explore the model
# In R, lines starting with # are comments and are not run.
slice_plot(50*flat(x) + 120*steady(x) ~ x, domain(x = 0:12))
```

**1.** In this linear combination, what are the two "ingredient" functions?

```{mcq}
#| label: fcw-ingredients
1. 50 and 120
2. flat() and steady($t$) [correct]
3. R and t
4. dollars and hours
```

**2.** What are the coefficients in this combination?

```{mcq}
#| label: fcw-coeffs
1. flat() and steady($t$)
2. 50 and 120 [correct]
3. 0 and 12
4. R and t
```

**3.** When the café is open 0 hours, what does the model predict for revenue?

`r devoirs::devoirs_set(choices = c(0, 50, 120, 170), correct = 50, id = "fcw-R0")`

**4.** When the café is open 5 hours, what does the model predict for revenue (in dollars)?

`r devoirs::devoirs_set(choices = c(110, 550, 600, 650), correct = 650, id = "fcw-R5")`

**5.** The owner considers a different model: $R(t) = a\cdot$ **hillside**$(t) + b\cdot$ **flat**$()$.

What is the main conceptual difference from the first model?

```{mcq}
#| label: fcw-hillside
1. The second model has two coefficients ($a$ and $b$) instead of two fixed numbers (50 and 120).
2. In the second model, sales grow with diminishing returns (steep at first, then leveling off) rather than at a constant rate per hour. [correct]
3. The second model allows revenue to be negative for some $t$.
4. The second model uses a different input variable.
