**AM and FM radio: multiplication vs. composition**

You've probably heard of AM and FM radio. Both send a **signal** (e.g. music, voice) by combining it with a **carrier wave**. The two methods correspond to two ways of combining functions: **AM uses multiplication**; **FM uses composition**. We model both using the storybook function **osc**(): a fast **osc** as the carrier and a slower **osc** as the signal. Below we walk through both with R.

---

**Step 1: The carrier**

The carrier is a rapid oscillation. We use **osc** with input $5t$ (five cycles per unit time). In the code, that’s **osc**(5·$x$).

```{webr}
#| caption: Carrier — fast osc
slice_plot(osc(5*x) ~ x, domain(x = 0:2))
```

---

**Step 2: The signal**

The signal is the “message” we want to send — here, a slower oscillation: **osc**($t$), one cycle per unit time.

```{webr}
#| caption: Signal — slower osc (the message)
slice_plot(osc(x) ~ x, domain(x = 0:2))
```

---

**Step 3: AM — amplitude modulation (multiplication)**

In AM, the **height** (amplitude) of the carrier is varied by the signal. We **multiply** the carrier by a factor that depends on the signal: same input $t$ into both, then multiply their outputs. So the transmitted wave is carrier $\times$ (1 + modulation·signal). We use a modulation factor of 0.7.

```{webr}
#| caption: AM — carrier × (1 + 0.7·signal)
# Multiplication: both carrier and signal evaluated at the same input.
slice_plot(osc(5*x) * (1 + 0.7*osc(x)) ~ x, domain(x = 0:2))
```

The carrier’s **height** rises and falls with the signal.

---

**Step 4: FM — frequency modulation (composition)**

In FM, the signal changes the **argument** of the carrier instead of its amplitude. So we **compose**: the outer function is **osc** (the carrier shape), and its **input** is something that depends on both time and the signal. The wave keeps roughly constant height, but how tightly the oscillations are packed varies with the signal.

```{webr}
#| caption: FM — osc( argument that includes the signal )
# Composition: the signal is part of the input to osc.
slice_plot(osc(5*x + 2*osc(x)/(2*pi)) ~ x, domain(x = 0:2))
```

---

**Step 5: Side-by-side comparison**

Run the two plots below. In **AM**, what varies with the signal is the **amplitude**. In **FM**, what varies is the **argument** to **osc** (composition).

```{webr}
#| caption: "AM (multiplication): amplitude follows the signal"
slice_plot(osc(5*x) * (1 + 0.7*osc(x)) ~ x, domain(x = 0:2))
```

```{webr}
#| caption: "FM (composition): argument to osc follows the signal"
slice_plot(osc(5*x + 2*osc(x)/(2*pi)) ~ x, domain(x = 0:2))
```

**1.** In AM, what are the two "ingredient" functions (the two shapes we combine)?

```{mcq}
#| label: wtd-am
1. Time and frequency
2. The carrier (**osc** at a fast rate) and the signal (**osc** at a slower rate) [correct]
3. Amplitude and argument
4. AM and FM
```

**2.** Which way of combining those two functions does AM use?

```{mcq}
#| label: wtd-mult
1. Addition
2. Multiplication (carrier × a factor that depends on the signal) [correct]
3. Composition (signal goes inside the carrier's input)
4. Division
```

**3.** In FM, which way of combining do we use?

```{mcq}
#| label: wtd-fm
1. Addition
2. Multiplication
3. Composition (the signal is part of the **argument** to **osc**) [correct]
4. Division
```

**4.** In the FM wave, which storybook function is on the "outside" — the one whose output we actually hear?

```{mcq}
#| label: wtd-fg
1. The signal
2. **osc** (the carrier shape) [correct]
3. Both are on the outside
4. Neither; FM uses multiplication
```

**5.** What is the main *visual* difference between the AM and FM plots?

```{mcq}
#| label: wtd-visual
1. AM has one peak, FM has two.
2. In AM the wave's **height** varies with the signal; in FM the height is steadier but how **tightly** the waves are packed varies. [correct]
3. FM is always larger than AM.
4. There is no visual difference.
