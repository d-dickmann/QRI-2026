**AM and FM radio: multiplication vs. composition**

You've probably heard of AM and FM radio. Both broadcast a **signal** (music, voice) by combining it with a high-frequency **carrier wave**. The math behind each method is a different way of combining two functions: **AM uses multiplication**; **FM uses composition**. We use the storybook function **osc**() (oscillator): **osc**($u$) $= \sin(2\pi u)$, so one cycle per unit of $u$. Below we walk through both with R, using time $t$ as the input.

---

**Step 1: The carrier wave**

The carrier is a high-frequency wave. We use **osc**($f_c\cdot t$) with $f_c = 5$, so $C(t) =$ **osc**($5t$): 5 cycles per unit time.

```{webr}
#| caption: Carrier C(t) = osc(5·t)
# osc(u) = sin(2π·u); 5 cycles per unit time.
slice_plot(osc(5*x) ~ x, domain(x = 0:2))
```

---

**Step 2: The signal**

The signal (e.g. audio) is a lower-frequency wave. We use $S(t) =$ **osc**($t$): 1 cycle per unit time, a stand-in for the message.

```{webr}
#| caption: Signal S(t) = osc(t)
# The "message" (here, a simple tone).
slice_plot(osc(x) ~ x, domain(x = 0:2))
```

---

**Step 3: AM — amplitude modulation (multiplication)**

In AM, the **amplitude** of the carrier is varied by the signal. So the transmitted wave is

**AM**($t$) = $C(t) \cdot \bigl(1 + m\cdot S(t)\bigr)$.

Here $m$ is the modulation depth (we use $m = 0.7$). So we **multiply** the carrier by a factor that depends on the signal: one function $\times$ another, same input $t$.

```{webr}
#| caption: AM(t) = osc(5·t) × (1 + 0.7·osc(t))
# Multiplication: carrier and signal both evaluated at the same t.
slice_plot(osc(5*x) * (1 + 0.7*osc(x)) ~ x, domain(x = 0:2))
```

You can see the carrier’s oscillations, with their **height** (amplitude) rising and falling with the signal.

---

**Step 4: FM — frequency modulation (composition)**

In FM, the signal changes the **argument** (phase) of the carrier instead of its amplitude. So the transmitted wave is

**FM**($t$) = **osc**$\bigl(f_c\cdot t + k\cdot S(t)/(2\pi)\bigr)$.

So we **compose**: the outer function is **osc**, and its **input** is $f_c\cdot t + k\cdot S(t)/(2\pi)$ — a function of $t$ that includes the signal. We use $k = 2$ so the effect is visible.

```{webr}
#| caption: FM(t) = osc(5·t + 2·osc(t)/(2π))
# Composition: the argument of osc() is the phase (inner function of t).
# The inner “function of t” is the phase; the outer function is osc.
slice_plot(osc(5*x + 2*osc(x)/(2*pi)) ~ x, domain(x = 0:2))
```

Here the **frequency** of the wave (how tightly the oscillations are packed) changes with the signal, while the amplitude stays constant.

---

**Step 5: Side-by-side comparison**

Run the two plots below one after the other. In the **AM** plot, what varies with the signal is the **amplitude** (multiplication). In the **FM** plot, what varies is the **phase/argument** of **osc** (composition).

```{webr}
#| caption: "AM (multiplication): amplitude follows the signal"
slice_plot(osc(5*x) * (1 + 0.7*osc(x)) ~ x, domain(x = 0:2))
```

```{webr}
#| caption: "FM (composition): phase/argument follows the signal"
slice_plot(osc(5*x + 2*osc(x)/(2*pi)) ~ x, domain(x = 0:2))
```

**1.** In the AM formula **AM**($t$) = $C(t) \cdot (1 + m\cdot S(t))$, which mathematical operation combines the carrier $C$ and the signal $S$?

```{mcq}
#| label: wtd-am
1. Addition
2. Multiplication [correct]
3. Composition (one function’s output as the other’s input)
4. Division
```

**2.** In the FM formula **FM**($t$) = **osc**($f_c\cdot t + k\cdot S(t)/(2\pi)$), the signal $S(t)$ appears inside the **argument** of **osc**. Which way of combining functions does that represent?

```{mcq}
#| label: wtd-fm
1. Addition
2. Multiplication
3. Composition (the phase $f_c t + k\cdot S(t)/(2\pi)$ is the input to **osc**) [correct]
4. Division
```

**3.** If we wrote the FM wave as **FM**($t$) = $f\bigl(g(t)\bigr)$ for two functions $f$ and $g$, what would $f$ be, and what would $g(t)$ be?

```{mcq}
#| label: wtd-fg
1. $f$ = carrier, $g(t)$ = signal
2. $f$ = **osc**, $g(t)$ = $f_c\cdot t + k\cdot S(t)/(2\pi)$ (the phase) [correct]
3. $f$ = signal, $g(t)$ = carrier
4. $f$ = **osc**, $g(t)$ = $S(t)$ only
```
